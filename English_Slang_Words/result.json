    "📌7 slang words you need to know in 2017\n\n1. Savage\n\nDone something totally cool and badass? Describe it to your friends as savage and watch as they look really confused but also pretty impressed. Remember: you didn’t choose the thug life – it chose you.\n\n2. Low-key\n\nWhen you’re secretly enjoying something, you’re low-key loving it. Kind of like keeping something on the D.L. (the down low), we all secretly hope someone is in low-key in love with us, but then we remember that person is a celebrity, so they’re probably not (sob).\n\n3. Done\n\nTired of someone’s attitude? Can’t face going to work in the morning? You’re done with it. You can even capitalise it for extra effect. I’m done with this explanation. DONE.\n\n4. Hundo P\n\nIf you totally agree with something someone says, you agree with it “100 per cent” – or, if you’re a millennial, you agree hundo p. It’s really just an abbreviation of 100 per cent, and it’s so fun to use I’ve been saying it all week. It’s hundo p my new favourite phrase.\n\n5. Dead/dying\n\nNot to be confused with physically not being alive anymore, dead (and its cousin dying) are 2017’s way of saying you’re so shocked/delighted/entertained it’s figuratively killed you – kind of like dying from laughter except not actually dying, because that would be both tragic and impossible.\n\n6. Extra\n\nPerhaps the word gaining the fastest popularity right now is extra, which describes someone who’s over-the-top or trying too hard. Knowing this might even force you to realise you yourself are extra about something, which is a distressing but ultimately necessary discovery.\n\n7. Going\n\nThis one is more popular in the UK and started life as spoken by people who live in the popular but slightly trashy county of Essex, north-east of London. Instead of saying you’re going to (insert place), you just say you’re going there. So, “let’s go to Nando’s” becomes “let’s go Nando’s”. And if you’re not sure what Nando’s is, you need to go live in the UK right now.\n\n🔰 ",

    "➰Do you know what I love about English? There are so many fun expressions. Especially American slang and idioms. They really make the difference between someone who learned school English and someone who speaks real everyday English.\nToday, you’ll learn 7 American slang expressions so you sound more natural, when you speak English.\n\n💢to pig out\n✍🏾Pigs aren’t clean animals, and when they eat, it’s not pretty. That’s why Americans use the expression “to pig out” when someone eats a lot of food, generally in an unrefined, messy way.\nIf your friend says “We pigged out at the buffet” they didn’t eat a lot of pork, they just ate a lot of food.\n\n💢to screw up something\n✍🏾If your colleague tells you “We really screwed up the project”, they’re not talking about a do-it-yourself project.\nIt means everything went wrong, they made a lot of mistakes, and the project was a disaster. Basically, if someone tells you they’ve screwed up, it’s never a good thing.\n\n💢to take a raincheck\n✍🏾If a friend wants you to do something with them and you’re not available at that moment, you can say “Can I take a raincheck?” It means “I can’t now, but I’d like to at another time.”\nThe expression comes from baseball! If the weather was bad, spectators could get a ticket to come see the game later, when the weather was better.\n\n💢to jack up the prices\n✍🏾In the summer months, hotels and airlines increase their prices because everyone wants to make a booking. During winter vacation, ski resorts jack up their prices.\nSo, “to jack up prices”  means to suddenly increase prices. This expression has a negative connotation. You’re not happy and you think the price increase is unfair.\n“What?! The hotel costs only $40 a night in February! And it’s $100 in July. They really jack up their prices. Those thieves!”\n\n💢to drive someone up the wall\n✍🏾If you’ve ever been in a room with 10 hyperactive children, you might tell your friend “These kids drive me up the wall.”\nIt means they’re making you crazy and irritated. Imagine that you feel crazy enough to try to drive your car up the wall of a building. That’s the emotion this expression conveys.\n\n💢to ride shotgun\n✍🏾This expression comes from the American Far West, when the person sitting next to the driver of a stagecoach needed a shotgun to defend against attackers.\nToday, we say the person in the passenger seat in a car is riding shotgun. So riding shotgun is less violent than you imagine. Except if it’s two teenagers fighting over who has the privilege of riding shotgun…\n\n💢a couch potato\n✍🏾This one is funny if you imagine literally a big fat potato sitting on a couch. It’s not very nice to call someone “a couch potato” because it means they just sit on a couch all day and watch TV, look at their smartphone, or play video games.\nIt’s certainly a good way to have the physique of a potato!\nDon’t be a couch potato, but do watch today’s lesson on American slang!\n\n📌 ",

    "🔰10 American Slang Words You Need to Know (Part 1)\n\n✍🏻For many international students, moving to the United States can be daunting. Not only are they exposed to a myriad of unfamiliar customs, they are also bombarded with a myriad of unfamiliar American slang words. Because these words are often not included in a formal English education, it can be grueling for international students to grow accustomed to their widespread, and arguably excessive, use. Here’s a run down on some of the most common slang. It will help you understand your friends better, it will help you fit in and of course it will help you avoid any more embarrassing situations.\n\n#1. Cool (adj) \n\n✍🏽Cool (adj) means ‘great’ or ‘fantastic’. It also shows that you’re okay with an idea.\n\n🔺“Okay, cool! I'll be there at 7:00”(okay with an idea)\n\n🔺“He passed the exam, Cool!”(means “great!”)\n\n#2. To be beat (adj)\n\n✍🏽To be beat (adj) If you hear a friend saying I’m beat, it means he or she is very tired or exhausted.    \n\n“Will you attend the football match with Tiger School?”\n\n“Sorry, I can’t. I’m beat. I did not sleep last night”\n\n#3. Awesome (adj)\n\n✍🏽Awesome (adj) like “Cool”, it means “excellent”, “great” or “remarkable”. It can be used in a sentence or it could be used in a one word reply.\n\n“That was awesome!”\n\n“Awesome, dude!”\n\n#4.

The practice of draft dashing breaks FF etiquette and is one of the most frustrating aspects of FF.\n\nThe draft dasher usually just likes the rush and strategy of putting a team together but not the monotony of setting a lineup every week. Also, the owner's team could just be really bad and they don't want to manage it anymore.\n\n"

It grew in popularity as musicians and athletes started performing the dance move. The dance also simply goes by the name dab, which is also known as a form of marijuana.\n\n❓ "

Examples include cultural differences and racial injustices.\n\nWokeness is a proclamation and challenge to others, especially those who may be oblivious about discrimination. The challenge is to not give in to pressures from other people and stand firm with those being oppressed.\n\nWoke is often used in the context of \"stay woke\" or \"get woke\" and is associated with movements like Black Lives Matter (BLM). In this instance, a woke individual may be a white person who has become aware of privileges they experience because of their skin color.\n\nThe term is also politically charged; it is often associated with liberals and denounced by conservatives. You will most likely see or hear it used on social media, in the news, and in in-person discussions regarding race or politics.\n\n❓"

It has become a rallying cry for people resisting or uncovering corrupt, unfair, and incorrect practices performed by people in positions of power, especially the government.\n\nWhile some date the phrase back to Ancient Greece, its modern-day roots go back to the early 1940s, when it was popularized by American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. He advocated for nonviolent methods for battling greater powers to achieve social justice.\n\n\"Speak truth to power\" has been adopted by various nonviolent resistance groups over the years, including against the Soviet Union during the Cold War and against the Taliban in the Middle East. It gained more exposure in the late-2010s, especially on social media, as a way to encourage dissidents to rebel.\n\nYou will probably see it in protests for racial justice, gender equality, LGBTQ rights, censorship, and other issues defying government laws or the \"status quo.\" The phrase is prevalent on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat among social activists.\n\n❓"

The other is the \"snake draft\" or \"serpentine draft,\" where the team with the last pick in the first round has the first pick in the second round and so on. In an auction draft, each team has an alotted amount of money, usually $100 or $200, to bid on players to fill their roster. This type of draft is especially popular in a \"keeper league\" because it allows the owner to choose his players rather than leaving it up to the luck of draft position.\n\n"

The person is being overly dramatic and needs to be reined in, such as a plastered broseph trying to jump from a house roof into the pool or a teacher that is too strict. The term may also describe a person who is trying too hard, whether it be attempting to fit in or throw the best party ever.\n\nTypically, extra is used as a negative term, similar to basic, and is meant to be a criticism of a person's behavior. If you are called \"extra\" you should try to take a step back and chill. It is commonly used as a noun or adjective.\n\n❓"

It includes browsing profiles of people near your location and swiping right or left on people that you like or dislike in order to match you with a mutually interested person.\n\nThe Tinder app was released in 2012 and quickly grew in popularity. Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select. This version only allows celebrities and other Tinder users who have a proficient track record on the app.\n\n❓"

    "\n\nSimping is when a person obsesses over someone and does things that he wouldn't normally do in order to please that person. It is primarily used online to criticize and make fun of a person for exerting a lot of effort to make someone happy who doesn't share the same romantic feelings.\n\nWhile traces of the term date back to the mid-2000s, it did not become popular until the late-2010s. Teenagers and young adults mostly use the term on social media, especially on Twitter and TikTok, to call out others for acting like simps.\n\nSimping is commonly done by a heterosexual male who is pursuing a disinterested girl in order to make her like him. He may say or do things out of his character in order to appeal to her desires. While simping is not as creepy as stalking it is seen as pathetic because everyone can see that it is desperate and a fruitless endeavor except for the simp.\n\nThe female being pursued may be unaware that she's breadcrumbing the guy. Or she may be doing it on purpose because she likes the focused attention.\n\nSimping may also be used to make fun of guys who are just generally kind to a female without getting any sexual favors in return. This type of criticism has been scrutinized since it promotes \"toxic masculinity\" where it's only worth it for guys to be kind to women if they can get something out of it. Some claim that \"SIMP\" stands for \"Suckas Idolizing Mediocre P****.\"\n\nWhile simping is primarily done by desperate guys, girls may also be guilty of it when they are hopelessly infatuated with someone.\n\n❓",

It is primarily used online to criticize and make fun of a person for exerting a lot of effort to make someone happy who doesn't share the same romantic feelings.\n\nWhile traces of the term date back to the mid-2000s, it did not become popular until the late-2010s. Teenagers and young adults mostly use the term on social media, especially on Twitter and TikTok, to call out others for acting like simps.\n\nSimping is commonly done by a heterosexual male who is pursuing a disinterested girl in order to make her like him. He may say or do things out of his character in order to appeal to her desires. While simping is not as creepy as stalking it is seen as pathetic because everyone can see that it is desperate and a fruitless endeavor except for the simp.\n\nThe female being pursued may be unaware that she's breadcrumbing the guy. Or she may be doing it on purpose because she likes the focused attention.\n\nSimping may also be used to make fun of guys who are just generally kind to a female without getting any sexual favors in return. This type of criticism has been scrutinized since it promotes \"toxic masculinity\" where it's only worth it for guys to be kind to women if they can get something out of it. Some claim that \"SIMP\" stands for \"Suckas Idolizing Mediocre P****.\"\n\nWhile simping is primarily done by desperate guys, girls may also be guilty of it when they are hopelessly infatuated with someone.\n\n❓"

These videos often included the YouTubers' search for VSCO girl-appropriate accessories, including Fjallraven Kanken backpacks, metal straws, and flashy scrunchies.\n\nBecause VSCO girls are predominantly white, thin, and affluent, and they've adopted slang (like sksksk and \"And I oop\") that originated in other online communities, reporters and critics have often called the VSCO girl trend exclusionary. VSCO girls themselves are often mocked as being basic, because they cling so strongly to certain brands and social media trends.\n\n❓ ",

These videos often included the YouTubers' search for VSCO girl-appropriate accessories, including Fjallraven Kanken backpacks, metal straws, and flashy scrunchies.\n\nBecause VSCO girls are predominantly white, thin, and affluent, and they've adopted slang (like sksksk and \"And I oop\") that originated in other online communities, reporters and critics have often called the VSCO girl trend exclusionary. VSCO girls themselves are often mocked as being basic, because they cling so strongly to certain brands and social media trends.\n\n❓ "

It includes browsing profiles of people near your location and swiping right or left on people that you like or dislike in order to match you with a mutually interested person.\n\nThe Tinder app was released in 2012 and quickly grew in popularity. Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select. This version only allows celebrities and other Tinder users who have a proficient track record on the app.\n\n❓",

It includes browsing profiles of people near your location and swiping right or left on people that you like or dislike in order to match you with a mutually interested person.\n\nThe Tinder app was released in 2012 and quickly grew in popularity. Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select. This version only allows celebrities and other Tinder users who have a proficient track record on the app.\n\n❓"

It is similar to the \"ole ball and chain\" expression used to refer to a SO. Cuffing is popular during the late fall and winter months, which is known as cuffing season.\n\n❓"

Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select.

It includes browsing profiles of people near your location and swiping right or left on people that you like or dislike in order to match you with a mutually interested person.\n\nThe Tinder app was released in 2012 and quickly grew in popularity. Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select. This version only allows celebrities and other Tinder users who have a proficient track record on the app.\n\n❓"

The first scenario is when something surprising happens, such as when a main character is killed off in a show by being shoved in front of a subway train. The second scenario is when someone gets dissed. The insult could be very aggressive or one that you didn't see coming.\n\n❓"

It is done with the intention of limiting the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\n\nThe term was coined as the COVID-19 virus reached the United States in early March 2020. Some health officials and politicians began doing it as a substitute for the normal handshake and people online began referring to it as the \"Corona bump.\"\n\nThe social maneuver is part of an overall effort to increase social distancing among individuals to slow the virus. However, it is still not completely effective as the virus can be transferred through sneezed or cough droplets. And if you are close enough to tap elbows, you are close enough to catch coughed or sneezed droplets. Because of this, some people choose to do an \"air-five\" or mime a handshake at least 6 feet away from the other person.\n\n❓",

It is done with the intention of limiting the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\n\nThe term was coined as the COVID-19 virus reached the United States in early March 2020. Some health officials and politicians began doing it as a substitute for the normal handshake and people online began referring to it as the \"Corona bump.\"\n\nThe social maneuver is part of an overall effort to increase social distancing among individuals to slow the virus. However, it is still not completely effective as the virus can be transferred through sneezed or cough droplets. And if you are close enough to tap elbows, you are close enough to catch coughed or sneezed droplets. Because of this, some people choose to do an \"air-five\" or mime a handshake at least 6 feet away from the other person.\n\n❓"

Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select.

It includes browsing profiles of people near your location and swiping right or left on people that you like or dislike in order to match you with a mutually interested person.\n\nThe Tinder app was released in 2012 and quickly grew in popularity. Tindering is mostly done by people in their 20s and 30s and is used to go on dates or for a straight up booty call. There also is an invite-only version of Tinder called Tinder Select. This version only allows celebrities and other Tinder users who have a proficient track record on the app.\n\n❓"

Now, even when only two or three sisters feature in a photo, they're likely to assume the sorority squat.\n\nWhenever anyone other than a college-aged female attempts to perform the sorority squat, they typically look ridiculous. So if you're reading this and thinking you might adopt the sorority squat in your next group photo, you may want to reconsider.\n\n❓"

However, because some of those singers are considered incredibly demanding, diva can now be used to refer to any demanding person (typically, a woman).\n\nWhat is the origin of diva?\n\nDiva is the Latin word for goddess. As opera grew popular in Italy, successful female stars were labeled divas, to note their larger-than-life style and presence.\n\nIn the modern age, diva crossed the divide between opera and pop music. Talented female singers who exude stage presence and personality are often labeled divas. In many cases, people admire these sorts of divas.\n\nHowever, because some divas are temperamental and hard to please, diva gained a secondary meaning. Now, volatile and/or whiny people of all stripes may also be labeled divas.\n\n❓",

However, because some of those singers are considered incredibly demanding, diva can now be used to refer to any demanding person (typically, a woman).\n\nWhat is the origin of diva?\n\nDiva is the Latin word for goddess. As opera grew popular in Italy, successful female stars were labeled divas, to note their larger-than-life style and presence.\n\nIn the modern age, diva crossed the divide between opera and pop music. Talented female singers who exude stage presence and personality are often labeled divas. In many cases, people admire these sorts of divas.\n\nHowever, because some divas are temperamental and hard to please, diva gained a secondary meaning. Now, volatile and/or whiny people of all stripes may also be labeled divas.\n\n❓"

These workers may be moving on to similar-yet-new jobs, changing career paths, or dropping out of the workforce entirely.\n\nWhat drove the Great Resignation?\n\nA lot of things, really. For one thing, the pandemic caused many workers to value themselves and their time more. So, workers who were being treated poorly at their jobs or felt underpaid chose to quit.\n\nThe pandemic also caused many workers' jobs to get more stressful (e.g. food service workers dealing with increasingly unruly customers; healthcare workers dealing with constantly full hospitals). Many of these burnt-out employees also quit.\n\nFor these and a host of other reasons, including the increasing prevalence of WFH and WFA positions, a record number of workers quit their jobs in 2021. In April 2021 alone, four million Americans quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nWhere does the name Great Resignation come from?\n\nThe Great Resignation is a play on the Great Depression - the name for the worst economic downturn the industrialized world has experienced. Texas A&M professor Anthony Klotz is credited with coining the name Great Resignation, in May 2021. The Great Resignation is also sometimes called the Big Quit.\n\n❓",

These workers may be moving on to similar-yet-new jobs, changing career paths, or dropping out of the workforce entirely.\n\nWhat drove the Great Resignation?\n\nA lot of things, really. For one thing, the pandemic caused many workers to value themselves and their time more. So, workers who were being treated poorly at their jobs or felt underpaid chose to quit.\n\nThe pandemic also caused many workers' jobs to get more stressful (e.g. food service workers dealing with increasingly unruly customers; healthcare workers dealing with constantly full hospitals). Many of these burnt-out employees also quit.\n\nFor these and a host of other reasons, including the increasing prevalence of WFH and WFA positions, a record number of workers quit their jobs in 2021. In April 2021 alone, four million Americans quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nWhere does the name Great Resignation come from?\n\nThe Great Resignation is a play on the Great Depression - the name for the worst economic downturn the industrialized world has experienced. Texas A&M professor Anthony Klotz is credited with coining the name Great Resignation, in May 2021. The Great Resignation is also sometimes called the Big Quit.\n\n❓"

They are sharing their perspective but not in a way that conveys understanding of the plight of colored people. It comes across as condescending and totally inappropriate considering that white people have not experienced racism the same way that colored people have, especially in America.

The person is being overly dramatic and needs to be reined in, such as a plastered broseph trying to jump from a house roof into the pool or a teacher that is too strict. The term may also describe a person who is trying too hard, whether it be attempting to fit in or throw the best party ever.\n\nTypically, extra is used as a negative term, similar to basic, and is meant to be a criticism of a person's behavior. If you are called \"extra\" you should try to take a step back and chill. It is commonly used as a noun or adjective.\n\n❓"

Some examples of groups of people posers try to appear are jocks, goth punks, skaters, theater kids, and brainiacs.\n\nThe term is typically seen as negative since it is used to call out people who \"talk the talk,\" but don't necessarily \"walk the walk.\" Most people can detect a poser trying to fit in so it's better to just be yourself, instead of pretend to be someone you are not.\n\n"

    "A waiver hawk is an owner in fantasy sports, like fantasy football or fantasy baseball, who patrols the waiver wire to pick up players moments after they become a free agent. The name comes from the laser-like focus and patience of a real hawk hunting prey and an owner hunting a player that is placed on the league's waiver wire.\n\nThe waiver wire is known in real-life and fantasy sports as the period when a player is released from his team and before he becomes a free agent. There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n",

It plays off the familiar \"out to lunch\" phrase that describes people who seem not to be fully present, resulting in them making mistakes.\n\nTypically, lunching behavior is associated with getting slept off weed or crunked off booze. However, an individual who is lunching may just be an airhead.\n\nAn example of lunching is when you burn your hand on the stove while thinking about your plans for the night.

    "\n\nSimping is when a person obsesses over someone and does things that he wouldn't normally do in order to please that person. It is primarily used online to criticize and make fun of a person for exerting a lot of effort to make someone happy who doesn't share the same romantic feelings.\n\nWhile traces of the term date back to the mid-2000s, it did not become popular until the late-2010s. Teenagers and young adults mostly use the term on social media, especially on Twitter and TikTok, to call out others for acting like simps.\n\nSimping is commonly done by a heterosexual male who is pursuing a disinterested girl in order to make her like him.

There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n",

There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n"

    "A waiver hawk is an owner in fantasy sports, like fantasy football or fantasy baseball, who patrols the waiver wire to pick up players moments after they become a free agent. The name comes from the laser-like focus and patience of a real hawk hunting prey and an owner hunting a player that is placed on the league's waiver wire.\n\nThe waiver wire is known in real-life and fantasy sports as the period when a player is released from his team and before he becomes a free agent. There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n",

This is a big no-no in FF since it decreases the competition in the league. The term can also be used as a verb like, \"Carl is ghostshipping his team again.\"\n\n"

    "A waiver hawk is an owner in fantasy sports, like fantasy football or fantasy baseball, who patrols the waiver wire to pick up players moments after they become a free agent. The name comes from the laser-like focus and patience of a real hawk hunting prey and an owner hunting a player that is placed on the league's waiver wire.\n\nThe waiver wire is known in real-life and fantasy sports as the period when a player is released from his team and before he becomes a free agent. There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n",

The name comes from the laser-like focus and patience of a real hawk hunting prey and an owner hunting a player that is placed on the league's waiver wire.\n\nThe waiver wire is known in real-life and fantasy sports as the period when a player is released from his team and before he becomes a free agent. There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n"

They are sharing their perspective but not in a way that conveys understanding of the plight of colored people. It comes across as condescending and totally inappropriate considering that white people have not experienced racism the same way that colored people have, especially in America. Backlash against whitesplaining usually occurs on social media where opinions are more often exchanged.\n\n❓"

    "A waiver hawk is an owner in fantasy sports, like fantasy football or fantasy baseball, who patrols the waiver wire to pick up players moments after they become a free agent. The name comes from the laser-like focus and patience of a real hawk hunting prey and an owner hunting a player that is placed on the league's waiver wire.\n\nThe waiver wire is known in real-life and fantasy sports as the period when a player is released from his team and before he becomes a free agent. There is an order that teams are placed in to have priority to pick up players. The order is based on the team's record (the worst team has first priority) and how often they pick up players (when you pick up a player from waivers you go to the back of the line). Owners become waiver hawks when a player they deem as valuable to their team is going to clear waivers and they get up early in the morning to pick up the player moments after he becomes available as a free agent. This strategy allows the owner to not sacrifice his waiver order when picking up the player.\n\n",
