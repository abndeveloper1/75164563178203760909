This is without taking into account the fact that people were under the scorching sun for 12 hours, worked at night and they all had to be provided with water and food.\n\nJapanese engineers 40 years ago tried to build a copy of the pyramid seven times smaller. They wanted to build it in a month, they built it in a year. A truck and a helicopter were involved in the construction because the construction methods described in the story surprisingly did not work.\n\n"

An analysis of the plaster yielded an unexpected result: hemp was found in the mixture for finishing the walls.\n\nThe ancient plaster was studied in every possible way. The ancient Indian plasterers had added 10% hemp stalk fibers to the mixture of clay and lime, and the mixture gave the plaster almost supernatural properties. This mixture protected the wall paintings of the Tin Tal Temple from destruction and insects for 1,500 years. \n\nThe magical herb retains heat, regulates humidity levels, is non-toxic, fireproof and has soundproofing properties.

The ancient Indian plasterers had added 10% hemp stalk fibers to the mixture of clay and lime, and the mixture gave the plaster almost supernatural properties. This mixture protected the wall paintings of the Tin Tal Temple from destruction and insects for 1,500 years. \n\nThe magical herb retains heat, regulates humidity levels, is non-toxic, fireproof and has soundproofing properties. And all of these properties of hemp have been known since the 6th century.\n\n"

    "It is believed that elephants in the Americas disappeared with the end of the last glaciation, i.e., about 12,000 years ago.

    "Eleanor Rigby's grave and the Beatles' song \"Eleanor Rigby\"\n\nIn 1957 John Lennon and Paul McCartney met at a party at St. Peter's Church in Woolton.

There is a group of people who believe that it is a man-made pyramid. Some journalists write that the size of the Ural pyramid exceeds the largest Egyptian pyramid - the Cheops pyramid.\n\nSome people believe that it is left over from ancient civilizations. Looking at this mountain, it is easy to believe such theories.\n\n"

    "The main position of skeptics and adherents of traditional history: if the catastrophe is not mentioned anywhere, it did not happen.

When he wrote his novel Barbary Shore, he added a secondary character of a Russian spy to the story. As Mailer wrote more, the Russian spy's role in the story grew larger and larger, and eventually he became an important character. The strange thing is that after the novel was finished, the U.S. Immigration Service arrested the Russian spy who lived just one floor above Norman Mailer in his apartment building. The spy was Colonel Rudolph Abel, and he was reportedly one of the chief spies working in the United States at the time. One might say that this is a strange coincidence.

There is no mention of the layout in ancient sources, its age is impossible to determine what city it depicts too.\n\nThe layout is carved from granite, and this indicates the great capabilities of its creators, for it requires appropriate tools for processing. The question remains and how the ancient Indians were able to depict the city in volumetric model? To achieve such accuracy is necessary to look at the city from a great height, and for this you need equipment.\n\nDid the ancient Indians have such knowledge? If so, where did they come from?

    "How did people centuries ago manage to build such gigantic structures and without technology?\n\nThe ancient temple of Kailas (in Ellora, India) was carved into the rock stone by stone. By hand🤲 of course.\nThe dimensions of the courtyard are 82 by 46 meters at the base, and 30 meters high.\n\nThe structure is a freestanding tiered temple complex of 2,000 square meters. It took the Hindus of the Rashtrakuta Empire twenty years to build the temple, processing 200,000 tons of rock. This means that 27 tons of rock must be processed per day. \n\nIn addition to this temple, there are 33 rock sculptures carved into the same rock. They are, of course, carved by hand.\n\n",

By hand🤲 of course.\nThe dimensions of the courtyard are 82 by 46 meters at the base, and 30 meters high.\n\nThe structure is a freestanding tiered temple complex of 2,000 square meters. It took the Hindus of the Rashtrakuta Empire twenty years to build the temple, processing 200,000 tons of rock. This means that 27 tons of rock must be processed per day. \n\nIn addition to this temple, there are 33 rock sculptures carved into the same rock. They are, of course, carved by hand.\n\n"

    "Gebekli Tepe\n\nIt is traditionally believed that the development of religion became possible only after mankind mastered agriculture. That is, in order to begin building temples, people first had to settle near their crops. But excavations in the Turkish town of Gebekli Tepe may change the picture. On this hill are the remains of the oldest religious building known to mankind. It was built 5000 years before Stonehenge. At this time, as previously thought, pottery was not even known in the Middle East, and hunter-gatherers were running across the steppe for antelope and roe deer. To build this temple complex required the organized work of thousands of people. And they needed something to feed them, so they would not run away from the construction site in search of sprouts and apples. It is possible that people began to sow crops nearby, just to feed this rabble of builders.\n\n",

It was there, during the works on restoration of the local church, where the drawing of the mouse was found.\n\nSo, let's get into details. In Malta, an Austrian city, which is located in the federal state of Carinthia, there is a little church. It was built in the 13th century and is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

    "The Italian pyramid of Bomarzo can be considered an uncomfortable find. The megalithic structure was discovered back in 1911, of course, it was not explored. In 2008 the pyramid was rediscovered by local resident Salvatore Foschi, it was cleaned by ordinary enthusiasts, but archaeologists and historians never showed attention to it.\n\nThe reason is simple - it is not clear, in what historical epoch to \"put\" it, in fact the history of the Roman empire is painted literally on months and about a pyramid there is not a word. By its design and form the find does not fit into the generally accepted ancient history of Italy. It was decided to attribute the megalith to the Etruscan era and call it by the traditionally vague universal term - altar.\n\n\"A very interesting find. We don't plan to study it, of course.\"\n\n",

     "text": "The Italian pyramid of Bomarzo can be considered an uncomfortable find. The megalithic structure was discovered back in 1911, of course, it was not explored. In 2008 the pyramid was rediscovered by local resident Salvatore Foschi, it was cleaned by ordinary enthusiasts, but archaeologists and historians never showed attention to it.\n\nThe reason is simple - it is not clear, in what historical epoch to \"put\" it, in fact the history of the Roman empire is painted literally on months and about a pyramid there is not a word. By its design and form the find does not fit into the generally accepted ancient history of Italy. It was decided to attribute the megalith to the Etruscan era and call it by the traditionally vague universal term - altar.\n\n\"A very interesting find. We don't plan to study it, of course.\"\n\n"

The pioneering device has not gained widespread popularity, to the delight of companies that produce electricity by conservative methods.\n\nApparently, until the planet's resources are exhausted, we will learn about such inventions only accidentally and with great delay.\n\n"

What do you think, natural or man-made?\n\n"

The tubes are different in diameter, from 2 to 40 cm. They look very rusty and give the impression of some remains of an ancient system. A total of 12 of them were found on the surface.\n\nAccording to experts, the tubes are woven into a complex system and have an unusual geometry, indicating that the creators knew a lot about engineering and had special technology. According to scientists about 8% of the pipe composition could not be identified, the rest is composed of iron oxide and other impurities, the alloy also contains a lot of oxidized silicon and calcium, which indicates a solid age of over 5 thousand years.\n\n",

    "What the ruins are silent about.

    "The mystery of the ancient iridium mask 12 thousand years old\n\nAmazing artifacts of antiquity are causing a sensation not only among people, but also among scientists. When an old mask made of an unusual unearthly metal was found, many hypotheses were expressed.\n\nBut none of them could explain how ancient people managed to extract iridium from a cosmic body.\n\nThe mask was found in Florida. The uniqueness of the mask lies in the fact that it is made of the rarest metal - iridium. There is no such metal in the bowels of the earth. It can only be found in meteorites that fell to the earth's surface.\n\nExperts have determined the age of the mask. The age of the mask was determined: about ten to twelve thousand years. The mask is very fine work and many archaeological experts are surprised at the technological process used in the manufacture of this artifact.\n\n",

There is, however, a lake about a kilometer from the city, but in order for it to reach the city and turn it into a small Atlantis, it will take a whole sea of water to pour into it.\n\nThe excavated structure itself is also impressive - the arched openings, columns, and red bricks seem vaguely familiar.

    "The Rosenthal Effect\n\nA psychological phenomenon in which a person's expectations of the fulfillment of a prophecy largely determine the nature of his actions and interpretations of the reactions of others, which provokes the self-fulfillment of the prophecy. \n\nFor example: a group of college students (none of whom knew each other) were divided into pairs. One person in each pair, chosen at random, was given special information: some students in the pair were told that their partner liked them, and some that they didn't. The pairs of students were then given the opportunity to meet and talk to each other. As the researchers predicted, those students \nwho thought they liked their partner were nicer to their partner. They were more frank, disagreed less on the topics discussed, and were generally more cordial and agreeable than students who thought they did not like their partner.\n\n",

One person in each pair, chosen at random, was given special information: some students in the pair were told that their partner liked them, and some that they didn't. The pairs of students were then given the opportunity to meet and talk to each other. As the researchers predicted, those students \nwho thought they liked their partner were nicer to their partner. They were more frank, disagreed less on the topics discussed, and were generally more cordial and agreeable than students who thought they did not like their partner.\n\n"

And what is this tale of paper money they tell you? Did Catherine introduce it? Well, well... Tartary used paper money back in the thirteenth century! And notice that all Tartars had European faces.\n\n"

He knew exactly what the inhabitants of different countries looked like. So why did the great conqueror of all time turn out to be a European rather than a Mongoloid?\n\n"

    "It could have been 1724. Mankind has lost 297 years of through history\n\nThis was stated by the German historian Herbert Illig. In 1911 he published an investigation which stated that the loss was due to regular changes in the calendars of different peoples, due to misinterpretation of documents or deliberate falsification. \n\nThe most interesting failure was found in European history from 618 to 907. For example, the structures of the 9th century AD do not differ from those of the 10th century. There is no documentation of the rise of Islam in Persia and Europe during this period. There is no record of Jewish actions during the great upheavals-these 297 years are \"missing\" from many civilizations.\n\n",

In 1911 he published an investigation which stated that the loss was due to regular changes in the calendars of different peoples, due to misinterpretation of documents or deliberate falsification. \n\nThe most interesting failure was found in European history from 618 to 907. For example, the structures of the 9th century AD do not differ from those of the 10th century. There is no documentation of the rise of Islam in Persia and Europe during this period. There is no record of Jewish actions during the great upheavals-these 297 years are \"missing\" from many civilizations.\n\n"

The speed of the car that hit her was \"insane\" by the standards of that time - about 13 kilometers per hour, which was twice the maximum allowable limit. After this incident, engineers from all over the world began to think about how to keep people safe with a ton of cold metal moving on them.\n\nOne of the technologies that was supposed to prevent accidents on the roads was a bucket that opens with a button.\n\n"

    "The mysterious ghostly walls of Tibet\n\nThe photos taken by the German expedition in 1938-1939 show the Gyantz Plain of Tibet, its ghostly walls and fortified entrance.\n\nAfter the return of the expedition began a debate that lasted for decades - are these formations natural? I do not know what arguments geologists, historians and scientists make, but, in my opinion, if there is an even straight wall, of the same width, with the same \"towers\" of the same height, separated by equal gaps - it is quite a man-made structure. I suggest that critics show at least one such creation of nature on the globe (after all, if nature created these walls in the Gyantz Plain, then there must be others).\n\n",

    "Several hundred dilapidated megaliths and structures have already been found in the Urals and the Old Lens quarry fits in too well with the legacy of old civilizations\n\nOfficially, talcumagnesite was mined here. All quarries show traces of excavation at the bottom - at the Old Lens the bottom is evenly tiled. All over the world, quarries are built with a ramp to take out tons of soil - the Old Lens is built with steps. The official theory says that a certain engineer came up with the technology to cut the bricks of rock right in the quarry. But talco-magnesite is mined in the form of powder, and the equipment in the quarry is not designed for cutting bricks.\n\nSince 1974, the quarry was mothballed and until 2017 regularly pumped out the water that filled it. But, as soon as in the early 2010s people began to take an active interest in the quarry and put its photos on the Internet, the pump suddenly failed and sunk the quarry. \n\n",

It is unknown how the ancient builders climbed to such a height and what tool they used to cut the top.\n\n"

The masonry and buried arches seem suspiciously familiar from previous posts about the flood and clay drifts.\n\n\"On the ruins of the old world we will build a new world.\"\n\n"

It may have been numerous torches or candles, but they would have left soot, which does not occur. Also a burning fire in a confined space quickly absorbs oxygen.\n\nSome bas-reliefs in the pyramids point to a more advanced lighting system that would seem impossible for representatives of the ancient Egyptians. It shows the lamps of lighting, in two projections, also shows the connection of these lamps, from the lower electrode goes a wire into the stone, from which an insulator is arranged, and the electricity in the lamp is shown in the form of a wriggling snake. It is quite symbolic to depict electricity as a wriggling snake, which can bite and kill. In fact, it is a schematic device for extracting and using electrostatic electricity.\n\n",

     "text": "The mysteries of the lighting of the mines. Egypt.\n\nWhat did ancient Egyptian builders use for lighting when digging mines? It may have been numerous torches or candles, but they would have left soot, which does not occur. Also a burning fire in a confined space quickly absorbs oxygen.\n\nSome bas-reliefs in the pyramids point to a more advanced lighting system that would seem impossible for representatives of the ancient Egyptians. It shows the lamps of lighting, in two projections, also shows the connection of these lamps, from the lower electrode goes a wire into the stone, from which an insulator is arranged, and the electricity in the lamp is shown in the form of a wriggling snake. It is quite symbolic to depict electricity as a wriggling snake, which can bite and kill. In fact, it is a schematic device for extracting and using electrostatic electricity.\n\n"

    "The mystery of the birth of the soul. What causes us to be born on Earth?\n\nThere is no \"want\" or \"don't want\" here. The soul perceives the necessity of incarnation as natural and necessary as a dream for us. it is a kind of instinct of cosmic scale. It strives for incarnation itself, as it is the only way to transform accumulated energies and get new experiences.\n\nNot when the event has happened, but before the birth the choice has already been made and the events are predetermined. I would like to emphasize that parents give a child only a physical body and heredity at the level of physiology of the nation in which the soul is born.\n\nAt the moment when the time of birth (incarnation) comes, the soul sees its future life. Even if just for a moment, it sees all the connecting events and the whole burden of responsibility which it has to accept. And the more spiritually developed the soul is, the broader its access to the definition of the upcoming events in its life.\n\n",

    "Almost all maps prior to the 18th century depicted Japan as several times larger than it is today, and called the island Iapan.\n\nIt is interesting that the official history does not deny the existence of a larger island on the site of Japan, but it was supposedly at least 12,000 years ago, not 300 years ago.\n\nBut if this is true, why on all maps in the XV-XVI centuries it was Iapan? And why does the map show the same city names as in modern Japan? By the way, the population of the island is described with a different culture and a different appearance, if you compare it with the current Japanese.\n\n",

Only those in the streets were frozen, their hands covering their faces. All this affected the outcome of the scientists' conclusions.\nFor about two years after the study, the data was not made public. \n\nHowever, some time later, the verdict was released to the world.

The walls and buildings were melted to greenish glass in some places. The skeletons of people were in their natural lifetime poses. Only those in the streets were frozen, their hands covering their faces. All this affected the outcome of the scientists' conclusions.\nFor about two years after the study, the data was not made public. \n\nHowever, some time later, the verdict was released to the world. Mohenjo-Daro - destroyed by a nuclear explosion. Other scientists who have studied the remains have also supported this version. \n\nThe bones contained radioactive particles 50 times larger than normal.\n\n"

In Malta, an Austrian city, which is located in the federal state of Carinthia, there is a little church. It was built in the 13th century and is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

It has never been possible to determine the exact composition of the alloy...\".\n\nDo they want to convince us that, having a sample of the metal, experts could not determine its chemical composition? This kind of analysis is done in an ordinary laboratory in a metallurgical shop. The whole procedure takes no more than 20 minutes. Any sample, any metal. But the secret of the alloying technology itself can be really hard to unravel.\n\n"

It seems to us that it is possible to make any item, but it just needs a little bit more time.  Scientists always say that ancient man created such objects almost on an assembly line, using only wood and copper.\n\nOn the left are vases and a diorite figurine. They are 5,000 years old. On the right is the researchers' attempt to replicate the diorite vase with copper tools. This is the result they got in six months. Someone is either lying about the production technology or about the level of civilization.\n\n"

The find is at least 2.000 years old, but the age in it is not the most valuable thing. \n\nSpectrographic analysis showed that the sword contains 90% aluminum. You may ask, what's so unusual about it? People didn't start mining aluminum until two centuries ago.\n\n"

Without the means of communication, such a duty collection point would be an easy prey for maritime robbers.\n\nAnd looking at this photo, try to guess what kind of communication there was.

    "An unusual mask was found in Florida. Experts determined the mask to be 12,000 years old, marveled at the technological process, and discovered that it depicts an Inca deity. \n\nBut how the ancient Incas created the mask of iridium - have not figured out. There is very little iridium in the bowels of the earth - just an admixture of other metals. Its main stock is found in fallen meteorites. Discovering it in 1803, scientists described the metal as \"hard, refractory, with high corrosion resistance. Let's assume that the Incas were lucky enough to get a meteorite and they could make a mask out of the capricious iridium. It remains to be clarified - how did the ancients extract iridium from the meteorite?\n\n",

     "text": "An unusual mask was found in Florida. Experts determined the mask to be 12,000 years old, marveled at the technological process, and discovered that it depicts an Inca deity. \n\nBut how the ancient Incas created the mask of iridium - have not figured out. There is very little iridium in the bowels of the earth - just an admixture of other metals. Its main stock is found in fallen meteorites. Discovering it in 1803, scientists described the metal as \"hard, refractory, with high corrosion resistance. Let's assume that the Incas were lucky enough to get a meteorite and they could make a mask out of the capricious iridium. It remains to be clarified - how did the ancients extract iridium from the meteorite?\n\n"

Houses have been covered by a cultural layer for 100 years and craters have not been covered for 350 million years, by age they should be deeper in the ground than the dinosaurs.\n\nThe same size is found in shell or bomb craters, because meteorites and asteroids do not have the same \"caliber\".\n\nSo, there is a very high chance that the craters are of artificial origin?\n\n",

They were all formed by meteorites falling about 350 million years ago.\n\nAll of them are the same size 2-3 km, except for a couple of very large craters.\n\nThe independent researchers immediately pounced on the scientists with uncomfortable but fair questions:\n\nin 350 million years, there shouldn't be a trace of the craters - erosion, exposure to animal and plant life would have flattened them long ago, or smoothed them out as if they never existed. Houses have been covered by a cultural layer for 100 years and craters have not been covered for 350 million years, by age they should be deeper in the ground than the dinosaurs.\n\nThe same size is found in shell or bomb craters, because meteorites and asteroids do not have the same \"caliber\".\n\nSo, there is a very high chance that the craters are of artificial origin?\n\n"

At the same time he always worked alone.\n\nA small number of eyewitnesses differ in their versions: two teenagers claim to have seen the huge stones floating in the air; others assure that they saw some equipment resembling a wooden tripod and some ropes (but even this equipment did not look powerful enough to lift such massive stone structures). \n\nEdward Lidskalnin is said to have used some kind of small black box, which he himself called a \"stabilizing perpetual motion machine.

He was short (about 1.6 m) and weighed about 50 kilograms, but such modest size did not prevent him from single-handedly moving stone blocks weighing up to 30 tons. At the same time he always worked alone.\n\nA small number of eyewitnesses differ in their versions: two teenagers claim to have seen the huge stones floating in the air; others assure that they saw some equipment resembling a wooden tripod and some ropes (but even this equipment did not look powerful enough to lift such massive stone structures). \n\nEdward Lidskalnin is said to have used some kind of small black box, which he himself called a \"stabilizing perpetual motion machine. Lidskalnin himself claimed to have discovered the secret of the Egyptian pyramids. It is a pity that he did not have time (or did not want) to share it with mankind.\n\n"

It is impossible to replicate it without high-precision optics of high-tech tools.\n\nIn previous posts we wrote about unique jewelry.

    "A puzzle for scientists was found in Shelbyville, Illinois, USA. The town was founded in 1827, which is very recent by historical standards.\n\nHow the town ended up 4-5 meters above ground is a mystery. It seems that it was built recently, the sea and oceans are far away, typhoons do not reach the center of the country. There is, however, a lake about a kilometer from the city, but in order for it to reach the city and turn it into a small Atlantis, it will take a whole sea of water to pour into it.\n\nThe excavated structure itself is also impressive - the arched openings, columns, and red bricks seem vaguely familiar. In most of the excavated cities, surprisingly, the buildings are built as if from a template.\n\n",

    "The Hope Experiment \n\nIn the 1950s, Harvard psychologist Kurt Richter conducted a brutal experiment: he put rats in a pool of water to see how long they would cling to life. \n\nIt turned out that, on average, they gave up and drowned after 15 minutes. This was the case with one group of rats. \n\nAs for the second, before the test subjects gave up, the researcher took them out of the water. He dried them, fed them, let them rest for a few minutes, and threw them back in. The rats were given hope. \n\nHow long do you think they could last in the second round? Another 15 minutes? Ten minutes? 5? No, the whole 60 hours! \n\nThe conclusion is obvious: because the rats believed in their continued salvation, they were able to force their bodies to perform the impossible and expanded their limit.\n\n'As long as a man does not give up, he is stronger than his destiny' Erich Maria Remarque\n\n",

    "About 10 years ago, miniature lead books were found in a cave in Jordan.

According to the marks on the stones, it appears that the sword was held perpendicular to the surface. But this is not conducive to sharpening. \n\nIt is interesting that identical traces are found on the stone slopes of Gotland.\n\n"

By the way, considers the Scythians the ancestors of our nation, lists the Scythian kings and gives them a detailed description.\n\nInteresting data on the founding of Veliky Novgorod: \"Novgorod was also called Uhrat and Nemagard, built at the same time as Kiev by the Slavs who came back from the Danube, about half a century after the Nativity of the Savior. The name of Novgorod was given to distinguish it from the city built before, which was called Slaven, at a distance of a verst from Novgorod, which was completely ruined by plague and war\". Slavic city which existed till 5 century A.D. and which became a basis for Novgorod, how do you perceive it? Sensation?\n\n",

By the way, considers the Scythians the ancestors of our nation, lists the Scythian kings and gives them a detailed description.\n\nInteresting data on the founding of Veliky Novgorod: \"Novgorod was also called Uhrat and Nemagard, built at the same time as Kiev by the Slavs who came back from the Danube, about half a century after the Nativity of the Savior. The name of Novgorod was given to distinguish it from the city built before, which was called Slaven, at a distance of a verst from Novgorod, which was completely ruined by plague and war\". Slavic city which existed till 5 century A.D. and which became a basis for Novgorod, how do you perceive it? Sensation?\n\n"
