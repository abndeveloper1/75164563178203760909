    " night monkeys (durukuls) are the only monkeys of the New World active at night.\n\nThey are common in Central and South America, live in family groups and feed mainly on fruits.\n\nNocturnal monkeys are relatively small primates with a body length of 25-35 cm and a tail of 30 to 40 cm . The weight varies from 0.7 to 1.2 kg, long and fluffy, its tip is often black. Unlike several other New World monkeys, it cannot be used for grabbing.\n\nDuring rest periods, nocturnal monkeys retire into hollows or dense thickets. About 15 minutes after sunset, they get out of their sleeping places and are active until midnight, after which they rest again for an hour and a half to two hours before they start looking for food again.

In addition, the animal firmly holds the caught prey with its claws. She has perfectly developed hearing and vision.

These martens arrange a den in an underground burrow, cave, hollow tree, hollow log, rock crevices and even under people's houses.\n\nThe usual habitats are moist rain forests and coastal thickets along the coast.

During sleep, their bright red eyes are masked by the lower translucent eyelid, painted in a golden mesh, which allows the tree frog to see prey or danger.\n\nWith the onset of darkness, the tree frogs wake up, yawn, stretch, change their light green daytime color to dark green at night and announce the surroundings with a specific croak. They are capable of making very long jumps.\n\nDuring rest, the eyes of the red-eyed tree frog are closed with a transparent membrane that does not prevent this frog from seeing the world around it. But if she is in danger, the tree frog immediately opens her eyes wide and confuses the predator with their bright red color - and these seconds are enough for her to instantly disappear!"

During sleep, their bright red eyes are masked by the lower translucent eyelid, painted in a golden mesh, which allows the tree frog to see prey or danger.\n\nWith the onset of darkness, the tree frogs wake up, yawn, stretch, change their light green daytime color to dark green at night and announce the surroundings with a specific croak. They are capable of making very long jumps.\n\nDuring rest, the eyes of the red-eyed tree frog are closed with a transparent membrane that does not prevent this frog from seeing the world around it. But if she is in danger, the tree frog immediately opens her eyes wide and confuses the predator with their bright red color - and these seconds are enough for her to instantly disappear!"

This case is ahead of even food in importance and urgency. The basis of the cover is a bag made of silk thread - silk is produced by silk glands (modified salivary glands), which open next to the jaws. As the caterpillar grows, this sac increases.\n\nThe cocoon should be smooth and dry from the inside: due to dampness and insufficient ventilation, mold can get inside the cover, which will lead to the death of the caterpillar. This explains the craving of baggies for sunny, well-warmed locations - dry pine forests, high riverbanks, forest edges, steppes, mountain slopes."

Eggs with bird droppings fall on the grass, where they must be swallowed by the intermediate host of the parasite - the Succinea amber snail. In the body of a snail, a larva develops from eggs - a miracidium.\n\nThanks to the coloring and movement of the snail horns, they become attractive to birds pecking and swallowing the \"caterpillar\". This is how the parasite gets into the main host.\n\nThis is how Intelligent Design Theory works through Evolution. By the way, maybe God just created it out of boredom..."
