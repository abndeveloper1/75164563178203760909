Undine is positioned near the piano bench, as if beckoning divers to sit down and play her a tune.\n\nThe stainless steel sculpture is hidden at a depth of 3-5 m, and it can be difficult to detect when the current lifts the sand from the bottom and the water becomes cloudy. These circumstances make detecting a composition on a clear day even more magical. Diving enthusiasts who can hold their breath long enough to dive like to swim around and sit on a bench, imitating their belonging to this underwater world."

Its open trailer will take you to the Helmer Lake, located at an altitude of 1860 m above sea level. Hiking mountain trails start from the lake. ⠀\n⠀ \nThe Gelmer Railway was built in the 1920s to support the construction of a dam on Lake Gelmer. The journey on this freight railway was very exciting, and in 2001 it was converted into a passenger railway.

In a word, this resort became popular even during the Roman Republic.\n\nToday, the island represents not only a rich culture, azure sea and sandy beaches, but also the island has become the abode of expensive and chic villas, boutiques of famous fashion designers, restaurants with local delicacies. And a yacht ride among the rocks of “Faraglioni\" will take you to the most picturesque places of the island.\n\n📌There is no winter on the island, so you can come here to relax all year round, but the cost of a hotel per night can cost from 100 to 700 euros.\n",

This exceptional beach gets its striking color thanks to microscopic animal foraminifera, which emit red pigment on coral reefs. For this reason, it is called Red Beach in the local language. When tiny fragments of red coral are combined with white sand, a soft pink color is obtained, which is visible along the coastline.\n"

    "🇨🇴Colombia, Andes\n\nThe Andes is the longest and one of the highest mountain systems on Earth, bordering the entire South America from the north and west; the southern part of the Cordillera. In some places, the Andes reach a width of over 500 km. The average height is about 4000 m.\n\nThe Andes are a major interoceanic watershed. To the east of the Andes, the rivers of the Atlantic Ocean basin flow. The Amazon itself and many of its major tributaries originate in the Andes, as well as the tributaries of the Orinoco, Paraguay, Parana, the Magdalena River and the Patagonia River. To the west of the Andes flow mainly short rivers belonging to the Pacific Ocean basin.\n\nThe Andes also serve as the most important climatic barrier in South America, isolating the territories to the west of the Main Cordillera from the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, to the east — from the influence of the Pacific Ocean.\n",

     "text": "🇨🇴Colombia, Andes\n\nThe Andes is the longest and one of the highest mountain systems on Earth, bordering the entire South America from the north and west; the southern part of the Cordillera. In some places, the Andes reach a width of over 500 km. The average height is about 4000 m.\n\nThe Andes are a major interoceanic watershed. To the east of the Andes, the rivers of the Atlantic Ocean basin flow. The Amazon itself and many of its major tributaries originate in the Andes, as well as the tributaries of the Orinoco, Paraguay, Parana, the Magdalena River and the Patagonia River. To the west of the Andes flow mainly short rivers belonging to the Pacific Ocean basin.\n\nThe Andes also serve as the most important climatic barrier in South America, isolating the territories to the west of the Main Cordillera from the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, to the east — from the influence of the Pacific Ocean.\n"

    "🇺🇸USA, Yosemite National Park\n\nThe unique beauty of Yosemite attracts tourists from all over the world. The National Park seems to be a treasure box, hiding the most amazing jewels of nature. Among the four of its famous waterfalls is Yosemite-this is the largest waterfall in the United States, its height is 800 m. This is one of the highest waterfalls in the world, it consists of three separate waterfalls: the Upper Yosemite Waterfall - 436 m, the Middle Cascades with a height of 206 m and the Lower Yosemite Waterfall-98 m. It's easy to get to the Lower Yosemite Waterfall, but it will take a whole day to get to the Upper One, and the path will not be easy. \nVernal Waterfall falls down with a white-foaming stream from an almost vertical cliff. The Nevada Waterfall is reminiscent of the wild primeval nature of the Sierra Nevada itself. The last in the list - but by no means the last in its merits - the waterfall \"Bride's Veil\" pours its icy waters into the valley.\n",

    "🇳🇴INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT OSLO - THE CAPITAL OF NORWAY\n\n1. Today Oslo is the most expensive city. When creating this rating, everything was taken into account: rental housing, public transport, food prices, etc.\n\n2. The weather in this city is also amazing, because it can change every day: drizzling rain alternates with clear sun, so the weather here is unpredictable.\n\n3. Oslo is often also called the city of sculptures, as there are hundreds of them here, and besides, they are very interesting. Most of them are in Vigeland Park.\n\n4.

    "🇺🇸\"Wave\", Arizona, USA.\nApproximately 180 to 190 million years ago, one of the greatest geological sites on our planet began to form in the USA. In the Coyote Buttes ravine on the border of Utah and Arizona, at an altitude of 1,592 meters above sea level, an “Arizona Wave\" formed, which eventually became one of the most popular destinations among hiking enthusiasts. This unique mountain measuring 19 m wide and 36 m long has an incredible undulating appearance and a massive sandy structure .

It is an ideal place for running enthusiasts of all ages.\n\nNordic walking, fencing, shatsu, tai ki and yoga are also practiced in the park.\nIn summer, you can swim in the Olympic pool next to the circuit. The best way to explore this paradise with all its hidden corners - 11 ancient farms, mills, Mirabello villas of the XVII century and Mirabellino (Mirabellino) of the XVIII century, taverns - is to rent a bike at the Cascina Bastia farm and quietly pedal, from March to October.

    "🇵🇹Portugal, Covandos-Conchos \nThere is an artificial lake in the Serra da Estrela mountains, in the middle of which there is a gaping hole. It looks like a portal to another dimension, but in fact it is a funnel leading to a spillway tunnel.\nLake Lagoa Serra da Estrela was created in 1955 during the construction of a hydroelectric power station. Instead of building a pipeline to circulate water between Lagoa Serra da Estrela and another lake, Lagoa Comprida, the engineers working on the project decided to drill a tunnel into the mountain.\nThe Covandos-Conchos discharge is designed to supply water to nearby settlements. The absence of other structures nearby gives the impression that this is a natural part of the lake. There is even grass growing on the slopes of the concrete funnel. Few people knew about this place until 2016, when photos with him began to be actively distributed by users of social networks.\n",

    "🇫🇷France, Benedictine Palace\n\nThe Benedictine Palace is located in the city of Fekan, the center of fishing and fishing trade. Until 1204, Fekam was the residence of the Dukes of Normandy, since that time there have been many historical monuments in the city. However, one of the most popular - the Benedictine Palace - was built much later - in the XIX century.\n\nThe palace owes its appearance to the local liquor. According to legend, in the XVI century, the Benedictine monk Bernardo Vincelli created an elixir in the Abbey of Fekam. 350 years later, in 1863, Alexandre Le Grand, a wealthy collector of ecclesiastical art, discovered the recipe for this elixir, made on the basis of 27 different plants and spices. This is how the world-famous Benedictine liqueur appeared.\n\nInside it is a museum, most of the exposition of which presents items related to the production of liquor and its history.

    "🇦🇹 🇩🇪Austria, Germany, Leutash Gorge\n\nUnique alpine meadows, picturesque surroundings, ecologically clean lakes, majestic mountains with eternally snowy tips - this wealth can be observed if you visit the famous Austrian resort of Leutas in Tyrol. It is in this region that the famous mystical and mysterious place - the gorges of the spirit of Loytash is located.\n\nYou can walk over the gorge on a steel bridge. This bridge connects two states: Germany and Austria. The gorge was opened for tourists in 2006. The length of the Dukka Gorge itself is about 3 km. When travelers pass over the bridge, powerful mountain streams flow under their feet, and sharp protrusions of rocks are located on the sides. The growling and bubbling of mountain waters, and unusual mystical images of rocks create the impression of a mysterious place that is guarded by some kind of spirit.\n\nYou can get into the gorge from Austria in the village of Leutash or from the German town of Mittenwald.\n",

    "🇨🇦Canada, Helmken Waterfall\n\nTravelers who have seen this waterfall with their own eyes claim that even the world-famous Niagara, located on the border of Canada and the USA, cannot be compared in beauty with the majestic Helmken. On the edge of the canyon, from which the waterfall jets fall, there is a safe observation deck, from which a stunning view of the surrounding area opens. The bravest tourists make their way directly to the water itself. Keep in mind that it may not be safe, so it's better to limit yourself to a fenced area.\n\nThe height of the famous Helmken waterfall in Canada is 141 m. A wide, full-flowing jet falls from a great height onto a stone plateau formed due to tectonic activity. It is noteworthy that Helmken does not freeze even in severe winter frosts – a small stream of water flows all year round, forming a giant glacier around. Desperate climbers throw an exit to an ice-covered waterfall and conquer it, risking their own lives.\n",

The staircase, consisting of almost four thousand steps, leads to the top of the Kulau cliff with a height of 850 meters. The climb is so steep that only experienced climbers can keep their balance during a dizzying ascent.\n\nThe staircase was built in 1942 for the needs of the military. The staircase turned into an iconic walking route, which was conquered by travelers in excellent physical shape.\n\nThe famous Hawaiian Haiku staircase, which is also called the stairway to heaven, will be destroyed in 2022. This decision was made by the local government due to the fact that the structure is an emergency and tourists are in danger while there.\n",

The climb is so steep that only experienced climbers can keep their balance during a dizzying ascent.\n\nThe staircase was built in 1942 for the needs of the military. The staircase turned into an iconic walking route, which was conquered by travelers in excellent physical shape.\n\nThe famous Hawaiian Haiku staircase, which is also called the stairway to heaven, will be destroyed in 2022. This decision was made by the local government due to the fact that the structure is an emergency and tourists are in danger while there.\n"

    "🇻🇳 🇨🇳Vietnam, China, Detian Waterfall\n\nThere are not many waterfalls on the planet that divide the territories of neighboring states. These are the 120-meter Victoria between Zambia and Zimbabwe, the 82-meter Iguazu on the border of Brazil and Argentina, and the 53-meter Niagara Falls separating Canada from the United States. The fourth largest border waterfall is the Detian Cascade: two 30-meter waterfalls in China and Vietnam. During high water, they merge into a common bubbling stream, and the sound of water breaking on rocks can be heard from afar.\n\nThe cascade is extremely picturesque at any time of the year: autumn fills the landscape with golden tones; in winter, the sleeping Detian is shrouded in fog, giving a touch of mystery and romance; in spring, its shores are painted with blooming flowers, and in summer - from May to September - it is a colossal rumbling stream, falling 120 m. The width of all 3 levels reaches 200 m.\n",

    "🇮🇹Italy,  Rocca Imperiale Commune\n\nRocca Imperiale, whose name can be translated as \"imperial rock\", is a popular resort located in the Italian region of Calabria on the coast of the Ionian Sea. Only about 3.5 thousand people live in the town all the time, but in the \"high\" season its population increases significantly due to tourists! This ancient Rocca Imperiale once played an important role, as it was conveniently located on the way from Puglia to Calabria. The city was founded in the 13th century by Emperor Frederick II and was named after the majestic castle towering on a cliff. The place for the construction of the castle was not chosen by chance – from the cliff there is a beautiful view of the entire Tarant Bay from the \"heel\" to the \"toe\" of the Italian \"boot\". The castle itself, from which only fragments of walls, bastions and bridges have been preserved, is currently undergoing reconstruction under the auspices of UNESCO.\n",

    "🇺🇸USA, Brooklyn Bridge\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge, which is rightfully considered one of the main attractions of New York, is the oldest of the suspension bridges in the United States of America.\n\nThere are many legends and mysteries associated with it, the Brooklyn Bridge quite often appears on wide screens in various motion pictures. The length of the magnificent bridge, which once made a real sensation, is 1828 meters. The Brooklyn Bridge in the USA crosses the East River Strait, it connects two districts of New York: Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nThe width of the bridge, divided into three lanes, is 26 meters, and at its highest point it rises 41 meters above the East River. Cars move one-way along two parts, and pedestrians and cyclists can walk along the middle part, which is located at a considerable elevation from the highways. Naturally, such a structure can be considered the safest for both vehicle drivers and pedestrians.\n",

    "🇹🇿Tanzania, Serengeti National Park\n\nSerengeti National Park was established in 1951. In the Maasai language, Serengeti means \"Endless Plains\". This is a very accurate description, since the park is the largest in Tanzania, it is located on a plateau, at an altitude of 914 -1829 m above sea level.\n\nRoughly comparable in territory to Northern Ireland and considered one of the largest nature reserves in the world, the Serengeti is famous for being home to 35 types of mammals, including lions, cheetahs, leopards, elephants, giraffes, hyenas, hippos, buffaloes, rhinos, baboons and antelopes, as well as more than 500 species of birds. Many of these animals are not found anywhere else in the world.\nThe annual migration of ungulates and zebras for 800 km in search of food and water during the dry season in May is one of the attractions of the park. It is impossible to forget the sight of animals rushing across the plains.\n",

This is a very accurate description, since the park is the largest in Tanzania, it is located on a plateau, at an altitude of 914 -1829 m above sea level.\n\nRoughly comparable in territory to Northern Ireland and considered one of the largest nature reserves in the world, the Serengeti is famous for being home to 35 types of mammals, including lions, cheetahs, leopards, elephants, giraffes, hyenas, hippos, buffaloes, rhinos, baboons and antelopes, as well as more than 500 species of birds. Many of these animals are not found anywhere else in the world.\nThe annual migration of ungulates and zebras for 800 km in search of food and water during the dry season in May is one of the attractions of the park. It is impossible to forget the sight of animals rushing across the plains.\n"

It was from this building that the name of the entire Hermitage museum was fixed. Now the building is a Small Hermitage.\n\nBy 1842, the collection had grown so much that it had little space in existing buildings, and, by decree of Nicholas I, a new separate building was erected - now the New Hermitage.\n\nToday, the State Hermitage Museum is one of the largest and most visited museums in the world.\n",

    "🇨🇳China, Chongqing City, A stunning road on the Lanshin Cliff, cut down in the mountains.\n\nLocated in Wuxi County, in southwestern China, the road to Lanying Cliff is an amazing trail cut in the mountains. Located on the southern slopes of the central Daba Mountains, the extremely narrow road is completely paved. This is the only transport route connecting Lanqing Village with the outside world. \n\nPreviously, residents had to travel almost all day to get out of the mountainous area. The road is steep, in some areas it reaches a slope of 22.9%. The 1.2 km (0.745 mile) long road descends from the cliff face, built by the villagers in 2001, who paved the road along the cliff to better connect the city with the outside world.

To clarify, the Athabasca Waterfall is located about 30 kilometers from the city of Jasper, after which the national park was named.\n\nThe area in which Athabasca is located is distinguished by rare beauty and simply incredible lush greenery. The height of the water fall at this waterfall is relatively small - 23 meters, but everything is compensated by the width, which is 18 meters. This guarantees any beholder an impressive sight.

    "🇮🇸Iceland, Seljalandsfoss Waterfall\n\nSeljalandsfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world. It does not differ in too high a height and is not considered the most full-flowing, but many tourists rush to it every year to see with their own eyes this amazing miracle of nature: noisy waters falling almost without touching the rocks.\n\nThis majestic Icelandic waterfall is located in the southwest of the country. It flows from a river called Seljalandsau. The nearest settlement is the small town of Skougar (30 km away). The Seljalandsfoss waterfall is truly unique. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it can be viewed not only from the outside, but also from the inside: behind the falling stream of water there is a natural depression in the rock, along which a trail for tourists passes. The continuously flowing waters of the Seljalandsfoss waterfall make a fascinating impression, there is a feeling that the water is floating in the air.\n",

    "🇫🇷France, Pierrefonds Castle\n\nPierrefonds (Chateau de Pierrefonds— is an ancient battle castle of the XV century, an important cultural and historical landmark of France.

The large-scale history of the building covers not only the period from the XIII - XV centuries, but also earlier French periods, starting from the XII century.  The castle of Pierrefonds has been depicted in many feature films, for example, \"The Eagle with Two Heads\", \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Merlin\".\n\nThe Hall of Beautiful Ladies and the Hall of Arms are the most impressive.

    "Abkhazia, Lake Ritsa\n\nThe high-mountain lake Ritsa can rightfully be considered the main attraction of Abkhazia. It has long been favored by locals and tourists. Previously, a mountain river flowed here, but after a large earthquake, part of the Pshegishkha massif collapsed in Laships, forming a natural barrier. Scientists suggest that this happened about 250 years ago. So it turned out to be the most beautiful lake in the country.\n\nThe area of Lake Ritsa is 1.27 square kilometers.\nInterestingly, the water in the lake retains its transparency at any time of the year, and the temperature does not rise above 18 degrees. In winter, the lake mirror is rarely covered with an ice crust. This phenomenon occurs only in the harshest winters. Trips here at such a time can be unsafe, due to snowfall and ice on a narrow access road.\n\nDepending on the seasons, the color of the water in the lake changes. This is due to the flowing rivers and the life cycle of phytoplankton.\n",

    "🇨🇳China, Human Anthill (Maijishan Grottoes) \nThis is one of the largest Buddhist cave monasteries in China in the form of an anthill.\nThe beginning of monastic life and the construction of the first caves is attributed to the period of the Late Qin dynasty (384-417 AD).\n\nThe grottoes are carved on the southern slope of the mountain, at an altitude of 80 m from the foot. Inside there are more than 7200 clay and stone sculptures, over 1300 sq.m. frescoes that were created from the IV to the XIX century. Here you can trace the stages of the development of sculptural art in China.   From one cave to another you can get only by a wooden path passing over the cliff.\n\nIn the uppermost cave known as the \"cave of Heaven\", a huge stone statue of Buddha with two attendants was hidden, apparently dating back to the era of the northern Zhou dynasty.

    "🇬🇷Greece, Thassos Island, Emerald Lagoon Giola \n\nThe Greek island of Thassos welcomes guests with wonderful lush vegetation, snow-white marble beaches and the purest sea. Among its most beautiful natural attractions is the Giola Lagoon located in the coastal cliffs.\nA lagoon with emerald-colored clear water is located near the village of Astris. A small pool of 15 by 20 meters was formed naturally under the influence of sea waves. The depth of the lagoon is only three meters, so the water in it warms up well and the bottom is very clearly visible.\nGiola Lagoon has the shape of a pearl shell. It is separated from the waters of the open sea by a low rock barrier up to two meters long. During tides and storms, waves easily overcome it and fill the pool with cool sea water.\n",

Among its most beautiful natural attractions is the Giola Lagoon located in the coastal cliffs.\nA lagoon with emerald-colored clear water is located near the village of Astris. A small pool of 15 by 20 meters was formed naturally under the influence of sea waves. The depth of the lagoon is only three meters, so the water in it warms up well and the bottom is very clearly visible.\nGiola Lagoon has the shape of a pearl shell. It is separated from the waters of the open sea by a low rock barrier up to two meters long. During tides and storms, waves easily overcome it and fill the pool with cool sea water.\n"

    "🇮🇹Italy, Lake Braies\n\nLake Braies (Italian: Lago di Braies) is a large mountain lake located in the Trentino Alto Adige region, in the province of Bolzano, at an altitude of 1,496 m above sea level. The total area of the water surface is about 0.31 km2, the maximum depth is 36 m. The lake is located in the Bryes Valley at the foot of the Croda del Becco Mountain.\n\nOne of the most popular activities on Lake Bryes is a boat trip.

Along the tourist trail there are places to relax, where you can enjoy fascinating views of Lake Bries in a calm atmosphere and, possibly, have a snack. The total length of the trail is about 3.6 km.\n",

The total area of the water surface is about 0.31 km2, the maximum depth is 36 m. The lake is located in the Bryes Valley at the foot of the Croda del Becco Mountain.\n\nOne of the most popular activities on Lake Bryes is a boat trip. This romantic and relaxing activity, allowing you to fully enjoy the surrounding beauty, was once the only way to cross to the opposite shore.\n\nNo less interesting will be a walking tour around the lake, which will take about an hour and a half and is suitable for both adults and children. Along the tourist trail there are places to relax, where you can enjoy fascinating views of Lake Bries in a calm atmosphere and, possibly, have a snack. The total length of the trail is about 3.6 km.\n"

Multilevel, with winding streets, narrow, steep alleys and stairs, the city is a fairy tale. There are such figures in cemeteries and just on the facades of houses that make your head spin, in old churches there are now markets, pubs and nightclubs, a bookstore looks like a museum, and schools look like Hogwarts. In general, if you haven't been to Edinburgh yet - go by all means!\n"

    "USA, Nevada, Fly Geyser\n\nFly is an artificial geyser located in the northwest of the U.S. state of Nevada. The geyser is located at an altitude of 1230 meters above sea level. The walls of the geyser continue to grow even now. According to the latest data, its height is almost 1.5 meters. The geyser constantly throws out three jets of water. Minerals (calcium carbonate), algae and cyanobacteria give it its current color.\nГейThe geyser has greatly changed the surrounding area. Despite the fact that this amazing phenomenon is considered to be a geyser, in fact it can rather be called a thermal spring, since the water here beats constantly (whereas the geyser throws out a water jet periodically). As for the Fly, the flow of hot water pouring out of it does not stop for a second, and the height of the fountains (there are not one, but three) is about one and a half meters.\n",

     "text": "USA, Nevada, Fly Geyser\n\nFly is an artificial geyser located in the northwest of the U.S. state of Nevada. The geyser is located at an altitude of 1230 meters above sea level. The walls of the geyser continue to grow even now. According to the latest data, its height is almost 1.5 meters. The geyser constantly throws out three jets of water. Minerals (calcium carbonate), algae and cyanobacteria give it its current color.\nГейThe geyser has greatly changed the surrounding area. Despite the fact that this amazing phenomenon is considered to be a geyser, in fact it can rather be called a thermal spring, since the water here beats constantly (whereas the geyser throws out a water jet periodically). As for the Fly, the flow of hot water pouring out of it does not stop for a second, and the height of the fountains (there are not one, but three) is about one and a half meters.\n"

    "🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿Scotland, Castle Stalker  \n\nIf you happen to visit Scotland, then you should definitely visit Castle Stalker. This medieval building is located on a small island. The castle is interesting not only for its antiquity, but also for the mystery that its walls hide. Most of its owners died a violent death.\n\nThe name of the castle Stalker translates from the Celtic as \"Falcon Hunter\". The history of this building began back in 1320. Initially, the castle was a small fortification. The fortress was the property of the Macdougallgalls.\n\nStalker Castle, which many consider cursed, attracts tourists not so much by its antiquity as by its mysterious and bloody history. In 2006, guests of Scotland had the opportunity not only to admire the building from the outside, but also to visit inside. You can visit the fortress only by appointment. Tourists are allowed to enter the castle in the period from May to September.\n",

Since 1982, the site has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. In addition to its unusual and amazing forms, the mountainous region also has historical value. Rock carvings, petroglyphs and archaeological excavations indicate that people lived here already in the Neolithic, about 9 thousand years ago, when the climate was milder, and there were savannas instead of deserts.\n\nThe National Park with a total area of 80k km2 is protected by the state. Tassili N'Ajjer is also a biosphere reserve. But to a greater extent, interest in the park is manifested for geological reasons.

    "🇹🇿Tanzania, Lake Natron\n\nLake Natron is one of the most famous natural attractions in Tanzania. It is famous for the fact that the water in the lake has a bright red color.\n\nThe lake is located near the border of Tanzania with Kenya, and covers an area of just under 1040 sq.m. It reaches a length of no more than 57 km, and a width of about 21 km. In the warmest months, the water temperature in the reservoir can exceed 50-60° C. The average depth of the Natron is 1.5 meters, and in the deepest places – 3 meters.\n\nLake Natron is the only permanent nesting site for small flamingos in East Africa. There are about 2.5 million individuals of this graceful species of birds. \n\nCyanobacteria, using the process of photosynthesis in nutrition, are the main producers of the color of Lake Natron. The color of the water can have yellow, orange, pink and red shades, and depends on the season and the number of such microorganisms.\n",

Like any oasis, Siwa owes its appearance to water: subsurface waters, which are rich in the eastern part of the Sahara, or, as it is also called, the Libyan desert, break through to the surface here with numerous springs, among which there is cold spring water suitable for drinking and irrigation, and warm and mineralized.\n\nIf you dream of getting off the beaten track in Egypt, then an extraordinary fertile pool in the remote Western Desert will console your imagination.

A wide, full-flowing jet falls from a great height onto a stone plateau formed due to tectonic activity. It is noteworthy that Helmken does not freeze even in severe winter frosts – a small stream of water flows all year round, forming a giant glacier around.

    "🇨🇳China, Huanglong Nature Reserve\n\nChina has one of the most amazing nature reserves in the world. We are talking about the Huanglong Nature Reserve (Huanglong - translated from Chinese as “yellow dragon\"), which is located in the highlands of Sichuan province. \nThe reserve is located at an altitude of 3500 meters above sea level. From a bird's-eye view, Huanglong really resembles a giant dragon, sparkling in the sun with its scales. The main pride of the reserve is the bizarre relief forms composed of limestone.\n\nFor tens of millions of years, precipitation and water flowing from mountain glaciers seeped through the earth. Underground streams gradually dissolved the calcite rock layer. And when the streamlet, having run underground, made its way out, calcite crystallized under the influence of the temperature difference and settled on any surface, be it shells of ancient mollusks, stones or plants. So nature has created travertine terraces with reservoirs.\n",

    "🇷🇺Russia, Karelia, Kizhi Island\n\nKizhi has long been not just the name of an island in Lake Onega, but a synonym for the unique beauty that Russian architects were able to create from wood. The Transfiguration and Intercession Churches, sparkling under the northern sun— are a symbol of Kizhi and all Russian wooden architecture. Tourists from all over the world come to Karelia to see these monuments, which are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nThe area of the island is only 5 sq. km. The length of the territory is 5.5 km, but the width is only 1.4 km.\n\nMore than 89 monuments of wooden architecture were collected on such a tiny territory. In the park you can see ancient chapels, wooden churches, houses, mills, and many barns. The pearl of the complex is called the Transfiguration Church of 1714, whose height reaches 37 m. This church is crowned by 22 domes.\n",

A bamboo grove is located in the west of the city of Kyoto in the Arashiyama district.

A small area of the grove is densely covered with bamboo. Some plants reach a height of 40-50 meters, thereby closing the sky. Because of this, it seems that you are in an impassable thicket.\n\nA bamboo forest appeared in the Arashiyama area in the 14th century.

Sometimes there are even queues of people who want to take a ride and jump on the \"bungee\" into the water. In fact, this is a recreation complex where you can swim in three natural pools of the waterfall, swim on a raft, swing and jump into the water from a bungee, have a picnic and even fry a barbecue.\n\nThe waterfall itself is low, consists of three rapids about 2-4 meters high each. It is worth coming here not to see the waterfall, it is not very spectacular, but to relax and swim.\n\nA series of small cascades with clear water make the waterfall a really wonderful place to relax. The lowest level has the deepest and largest pool, it is also easy to climb to the top to find smaller pools.\n\nThe best time to visit is summer, when the fast-flowing waters change color to emerald.\n",

    "🇹🇭Thailand, Wat Sam Phran Temple\n\nWat Sam Phran Temple is an original Buddhist temple with a height of 17-storey building in Nakhon Pathom province. From a distance, it looks more like a fairy-tale tower from Disneyland than a religious object.\n⠀\nOnly a few floors are used in the main building of the temple complex. On one of the floors there is an entrance to the dragon's body. However, it will be quite difficult to see anything, because there is no lighting inside the mythical creature. Only ten floors are available to visitors, it will not be possible to go further, since the remaining floors of the temple are closed. Some floors are used by monks as living quarters.\n\nIt is believed that if you touch the dragon by the tail, throw a coin into a special \"pot of happiness\" and hit the temple gong, then luck will accompany you all the coming year.\n⠀\n",

    "🇳🇿New Zealand, Waitomo Firefly Caves\n\nThe Waitomo Firefly Caves in New Zealand are a unique natural attraction. A real planetarium under the arches of the cave.\n\nNature has worked hard and created underground grottoes, abundantly filled with luminous insects Arachnocampa Luminosa. They are also called mushroom mosquitoes-fireflies, because the main food of this species is spores of fungi that grow in caves.\n\nThe main reason for the glow is as follows: mosquito larvae (up to 3 cm in length) hang special threads with a glue-like substance.\n\nLarvae catch small insects with these spider threads. Then the thread is wound and the caught prey becomes a delicious breakfast or lunch. And in order to attract \"food\", the larvae begin to glow actively. Scientists believe that the more the larva glows, the hungrier it is.\n\nInteresting fact - fireflies are afraid of noise.

     "text": "🇳🇿New Zealand, Waitomo Firefly Caves\n\nThe Waitomo Firefly Caves in New Zealand are a unique natural attraction. A real planetarium under the arches of the cave.\n\nNature has worked hard and created underground grottoes, abundantly filled with luminous insects Arachnocampa Luminosa. They are also called mushroom mosquitoes-fireflies, because the main food of this species is spores of fungi that grow in caves.\n\nThe main reason for the glow is as follows: mosquito larvae (up to 3 cm in length) hang special threads with a glue-like substance.\n\nLarvae catch small insects with these spider threads. Then the thread is wound and the caught prey becomes a delicious breakfast or lunch. And in order to attract \"food\", the larvae begin to glow actively. Scientists believe that the more the larva glows, the hungrier it is.\n\nInteresting fact - fireflies are afraid of noise. If you shout loudly, the magic lights can go out, plunging you into darkness.\n"

    "🇦🇪UAE, Dubai, Musical Fountain\n\nThe Musical Fountain in Dubai is located in the heart of the largest city in the UAE, surrounded by skyscrapers, restaurants and shopping malls belonging to the modern, wide-functional Downtown Dubai complex. The fountain is rightfully considered one of the tallest and most unusual in the world. Its length is 275 m, and the height of the jets reaches 150 m, which is approximately equal to the height of a 50-storey building.\n\nSeveral times in the evening, the Dancing Fountains of Dubai, originally illuminated by special spotlights, turn into a light and music complex, creating stunning compositions. The complex structure, controlled by automation, is located within the boundaries of an artificial lake, which stretches at the foot of the Burj Khalifa (or Khalifa Tower). On its facade during grandiose performances, you can often see amazing laser projections.\n\n",

    "🇦🇺Australia, Hymes Beach \n\nHyams Beach is a beach with the whitest sand in the world. That's how it appears in the Guinness Book of Records. Surprisingly, the local sand stands out in its color even in the dim light of the moon, it is so white. And on a sunny day, it just shines, so when going here on vacation, be sure to take sunglasses and sunscreen with you. The sand on Hymes Beach is not just snow–white, but also very fine - it feels more like flour or powdered sugar than sand rock. And some tourists compare it with starch for its characteristic creak.\n\nThe length of the beach is just over 2 km. At the same time, the beach is wide enough to fit everyone.\n \nHymes Beach is not just popular, it is known all over the world. It is here that tourists come to make unique shots against the background of snow-white expanses, relax, sunbathe and, of course, swim in the purest waters of Jervis Bay.\n",

    "🇧🇷Brazil, Cave \"Gruta Lago Azul\"\n\nGruta Lago Azul is located 20 km from the city of Bonito, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, it contains two caves with interesting but fragile limestone formations, and has been included in the list of protected areas since 1978. Gruta Lago Azul means \"Cave of the blue Lake\". \n\nInside there is a stunning lake of bright blue color with a depth of 90 meters. Its size makes it one of the largest flooded cavities on the planet. Prehistoric animal fossils such as giant sloths and saber-toothed tigers have been found at its base.\n\nThe best time to visit is the morning of a sunny day, on cloudy days it is impossible to appreciate the beauty of the cave.

The third Moscow Catholic Church.\n\nIt was built from 1901 to 1911, the interior was finished in 1917. By permission of the governor, the construction was carried out far from the center of Moscow and large Orthodox churches, without towers and sculptural statues. \n\nWorld-famous organists perform concerts in the cathedral. They perform works by Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart and other classics. Organ arrangements of rock compositions and music from the cinema often sound in the cathedral. On certain days, you can listen to a charity concert of organ music. \n",

The third Moscow Catholic Church.\n\nIt was built from 1901 to 1911, the interior was finished in 1917. By permission of the governor, the construction was carried out far from the center of Moscow and large Orthodox churches, without towers and sculptural statues. \n\nWorld-famous organists perform concerts in the cathedral. They perform works by Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart and other classics. Organ arrangements of rock compositions and music from the cinema often sound in the cathedral. On certain days, you can listen to a charity concert of organ music. \n"

    "Bolivia 🇧🇴, Uyuni Salt Marsh\n\nThe Uyuni salt marsh is called the pearl of Bolivia. This is the largest salt marsh in the world — 10,588 sq. km. It is located in the vicinity of the city of Uyuni, in the south of the Altiplano plain, at an altitude of 3,650 m above sea level.\n\nExperts believe that the Uyuni salt marsh, which arose as a result of the drying up of the huge lake Minchin, contains 10 billion tons of salt, of which about 25 thousand tons are extracted annually. The thickness of the salt beds ranges from 2 meters at the edge to 10 meters in the center.\n\nThe best time to visit the Uyuni salt marsh is the rainy season, which lasts from December to January, when the salt surface is covered with water and you can admire the unique mirror reflections of the sky with clouds.\n\nIn December, you can see all the variety of salt marshes, both dry areas where the dried surface is covered with patterns in the form of hexagons, and wet \"mirror\" zones.\n",

    "Australia 🇦🇺, Monkey Mia Beach 🐬\n\nManki Mia is a seaside resort with a charming beach. But this is not an ordinary beach that we are all used to. People are in no hurry to swim here, or sunbathe on the sand. Tourists are standing on the shore and waiting for special guests from the ocean. A distinctive feature of this beach is that almost every day 5-10 female dolphins swim to the shore with their babies, and frolic near the shore without fear of observers at all.\n\nThe tradition of feeding dolphins on the shore began in 1964. The wife of a local fisherman saw a dolphin swimming nearby and gave him a fish. He liked it and the next day the dolphin returned for a new portion. Over time, Charlie, that's what the locals called this dolphin, began to bring his friends to the beach. It all became a habit — Charlie and his friends increasingly came to the shallow water for feeding.\n\n This area has received the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n",

    "Russia🇷🇺, Dagestan, Karadakh gorge\n\nThe Karadakh gorge is one of the most picturesque corners of Dagestan, which is not so easy to get to, but you will not have to regret it\n\nThis natural monument in Dagestan is sometimes called the Gate of Miracles. The canyon is very narrow — only two to four meters wide, and the height of the \"walls\" reaches 170 meters. The gorge stretched for about four hundred meters.\n\nThe road runs through a pretty gorge, where you can admire the fractures of rocks, and a small forest stretches in front of the entrance to the gorge.\n\nThe gorge itself is very picturesque, its unusual curves rise to a height of hundreds of meters. The road is narrow — sometimes you have to literally squeeze between the rocks. And in some places the stones hang over your head.

The canyon is very narrow — only two to four meters wide, and the height of the \"walls\" reaches 170 meters. The gorge stretched for about four hundred meters.\n\nThe road runs through a pretty gorge, where you can admire the fractures of rocks, and a small forest stretches in front of the entrance to the gorge.\n\nThe gorge itself is very picturesque, its unusual curves rise to a height of hundreds of meters. The road is narrow — sometimes you have to literally squeeze between the rocks. And in some places the stones hang over your head. Light rarely penetrates here, but when it happens, the picture before your eyes is unforgettable.\n"

The surroundings of the lake are famous for the purest transparent air, the splendor of green forests and mown meadows, mountain peaks with snow caps.\n\nNot a single photo can convey the impressions experienced by tourists who visited these places for the first time.\n"

With its outlines, the island of Zakynthos resembles a cheerful penguin who decided to swim in the warm Ionian Sea to the west of the Peloponnese peninsula. This relief island of such an original shape is actually a densely forested peak of a mountain rising from the depths of the sea\n\nThe island of Zakynthos is quite large – 405 km2, and its coastline, broken by bays and capes, is measured at 123 km, and almost the entire coast is open to access to the sea.\n\nThe air of the island, which the Venetians called the \"Flower of the Levant\", is filled with intoxicating aromas of the sea breeze, coniferous forests, juniper thickets and spicy herbs, fruits of citrus trees and vines growing in abundance here.

With its outlines, the island of Zakynthos resembles a cheerful penguin who decided to swim in the warm Ionian Sea to the west of the Peloponnese peninsula. This relief island of such an original shape is actually a densely forested peak of a mountain rising from the depths of the sea\n\nThe island of Zakynthos is quite large – 405 km2, and its coastline, broken by bays and capes, is measured at 123 km, and almost the entire coast is open to access to the sea.\n\nThe air of the island, which the Venetians called the \"Flower of the Levant\", is filled with intoxicating aromas of the sea breeze, coniferous forests, juniper thickets and spicy herbs, fruits of citrus trees and vines growing in abundance here. The island still preserves the aristocratic spirit of the Renaissance and Enlightenment, when famous musicians, poets, and painters lived and worked here.\n"

The 30—meter bridge is the place where the International Diving Championship is held every summer.\n\nThe local authorities have made the fjord an attractive tourist destination.

    "Russia 🇷🇺, Lake Kezenoy-Am\n\nThe pearl of Chechnya is the so-called amazing high-mountain lake Kezenoy-Am. Its appearance is striking: the reservoir is distinguished by the turquoise color of the water, changing its hue depending on weather conditions, time of year and day.\n\nChechen lake Kezenoy-Am is considered one of the most beautiful. In addition, it is the largest alpine lake in Europe: its length from north to south is about two kilometers, and from west to east – 2.7! The area of the amazing reservoir reaches two square kilometers. It is often called Deep – in some places the depth is 72 meters. It is because of its size that it is also known as the Andean Sea. By the way, some scuba divers claim that the depth of the lake is actually much greater. For example, a Finnish scuba diver in 1989 plunged 103 meters. There are pictures of professional divers taken at a depth of about 90 meters.\n",

     "text": "Russia 🇷🇺, Lake Kezenoy-Am\n\nThe pearl of Chechnya is the so-called amazing high-mountain lake Kezenoy-Am. Its appearance is striking: the reservoir is distinguished by the turquoise color of the water, changing its hue depending on weather conditions, time of year and day.\n\nChechen lake Kezenoy-Am is considered one of the most beautiful. In addition, it is the largest alpine lake in Europe: its length from north to south is about two kilometers, and from west to east – 2.7! The area of the amazing reservoir reaches two square kilometers. It is often called Deep – in some places the depth is 72 meters. It is because of its size that it is also known as the Andean Sea. By the way, some scuba divers claim that the depth of the lake is actually much greater. For example, a Finnish scuba diver in 1989 plunged 103 meters. There are pictures of professional divers taken at a depth of about 90 meters.\n"

    "South Africa 🇿🇦, Boulder's Beach\n\nBoulders Beach is the famous penguin beach in South Africa, at a distance of about 40 km from Cape Town by road.\n\nAfrican penguins have been living on the warm coast since 1982. It all started with two breeding pairs, and over the years this colony has managed to increase to almost 3,000 individuals. Favorable conditions for exotic birds were created when commercial trawling of fish in False Bay stopped: the number of sardines and anchovies, which form part of the penguins' diet, gradually increased in the waters.\n\nEntrance to Boulder's Beach is paid, special bridges above the ground are equipped for tourists. In front of the main road to the tourist bridges on the left there is a barely noticeable path to the shore — you can walk along it to the free rocky beach, where you can also see penguins resting on boulders.\n\nNext to the penguin colony there is a free descent to the sea, where you can swim.\n",

    "Japan🇯🇵, Shikisai no Oka Flower Garden\n\nThere are a huge number of natural places in Japan where you want not only to visit, but also to live. One of such wonders of nature can be safely called the panoramic flower garden of Sikisai-no-Oka on the hills of the village of Biei, which offers breathtaking views of seven hectares of land abounding with 30 kinds of flowers against the backdrop of the majestic Daisetsuzan mountains. Its picturesque landscapes are very beautiful all year round and even in winter, when the territory of the hills is covered with a lot of snow. But still, in all its glory, the park will appear before you during the seasonal flowering period from April to November, when fantastically beautiful gentle hills are covered with waves of tulips, lavender, cosmea, poppies, sunflowers, purple sage and many other flowers, the aroma of which can stupefy anyone. \n",

    "🇮🇸\n\n🔶The Seljalandsfoss Waterfall is one of the few water cascades that can be walked around and viewed from all sides.\n\n🔶The peculiarity of the waterfall is that the water jets do not flow down the surface of the rock, but fall from a steep cliff 60 meters high, forming a spacious natural cave right behind the water wall. There is a stunning view from there.\n\n🔶🗿The cliff used to be a seashore, but over hundreds of years the coastline has moved away from it by several kilometers. Now there are spacious green plains on the site of the former seabed, emphasizing the majesty of the water flow.\n\nUnlike most of Iceland's attractions, you don't have to climb mountains or rough terrain for a long time to get to Seljalandsfoss. It is located right next to the ring road — an asphalt path less than 200 meters long leads there from the highway.\n",

    "🏰Finland 🇫🇮, Olofsborg Fortress\n\n🔶Olofsborg (another name is Olavinlinna) is a 15th—century fortress on a tiny island in the Finnish city of Savonlinna. This is the northernmost medieval fortress that has survived to this day. The island is connected to the mainland by a pontoon bridge.\n\n🔶Initially it belonged to Sweden, then it became part of the Grand Duchy of Finland as part of the Russian Empire, and then became part of independent Finland.\n\n🔶The fortress was founded in 1475 by the Danish knight, royal governor Eric Axelsson Tott. Then it was called Nyslott (then Saknt-Olofsborg) and served to protect the eastern borders of the Danish-Swedish kingdom.\n\n🔶Over time, a settlement was formed around the impregnable fortress, which in 1639 acquired the official status of a city and became known as Savonlinna.\n\n🔶Several historical expositions have been opened in the walls of the fortress, as well as a small collection of Orthodox icons.\n",

    "🏰Israel🇮🇱, Masada Fortress\n\n🔶Not far from the Israeli city of Arad, the fortress of Masada rises on a trapezoidal plateau of one of the rocks of the Judean Desert.\n\n🔶It owes its appearance to King Herod I the Great, who in the 25th year BC built a shelter on the rock for his family. However, it was not built from scratch — as a basis, the king used the remains of the fortress of the Hasmonean period (dated 37-31 BC).\n\n🔶Weapons, food, and gold were also stored in the fortress. There was even an artificial water supply, there were baths. Some of the buildings have survived to the present day. So, in the fortress you can see Herod's palace, a synagogue, baths, water tanks cut into the rocks, a pool for ritual ablution, and much more.\n\n🔶Once at the foot of a steep 450 m cliff, on which the fortress is actually located, some tourists prefer to climb up on foot along a narrow path, which is called the snake. \n",

     "text": "🏰Israel🇮🇱, Masada Fortress\n\n🔶Not far from the Israeli city of Arad, the fortress of Masada rises on a trapezoidal plateau of one of the rocks of the Judean Desert.\n\n🔶It owes its appearance to King Herod I the Great, who in the 25th year BC built a shelter on the rock for his family. However, it was not built from scratch — as a basis, the king used the remains of the fortress of the Hasmonean period (dated 37-31 BC).\n\n🔶Weapons, food, and gold were also stored in the fortress. There was even an artificial water supply, there were baths. Some of the buildings have survived to the present day. So, in the fortress you can see Herod's palace, a synagogue, baths, water tanks cut into the rocks, a pool for ritual ablution, and much more.\n\n🔶Once at the foot of a steep 450 m cliff, on which the fortress is actually located, some tourists prefer to climb up on foot along a narrow path, which is called the snake. \n"

For the first time Oravsky grad was mentioned in chronicle sources back in 1267. A century later, it was already one of the largest castles in the area. The palace on the territory of the City was built in the XVI century, and in 1800 the castle buildings suffered during a fire, and only in the XIX century its reconstruction in the Romanticism style began.

     "text": "Kazakhstan 🇰🇿, Charyn Canyon\n\n🔶Charyn Canyon is a unique natural monument, part of the Charyn National Park, which was opened in February 2004 in order to preserve and restore the unique natural monuments of the Almaty region.\n\n🔶Charyn Canyon stretches for 154 km along the Charyn River. An amazing natural monument is composed of sedimentary rocks, the age of which is about 12 million years. The height reaches from 150 to 300 meters.\n\n🔶To date, the canyon is visited by a huge number of people, because here you can not only go on an excursion, but also relax and do active sports. On its territory there is a tourist complex with gazebos, bungalows and summer cafes.\n\n🔶The majestic canyon is so popular that tour operators have created special tours that allow you to see the Charyn Canyon in all its glory. As a rule, all excursions to the canyon start from the city of Almaty.\n"

    "🏟️Italy 🇮🇹, Grotta Palazzese Restaurant\n\n🔶There is a city in Italy that is particularly popular among tourists. We are talking about Polignano a Mare. There is a famous Italian restaurant — \"Grotta Palazzese\", a pearl among local attractions, hidden in a cave. From there you can enjoy a picturesque view of the Adriatic Sea. The restaurant itself is located on a cliff, inside a limestone cave. Grotta Palazzese is the largest cave. It has the shape of a semicircle, the diameter of which is 30 meters.\n\n🔶The idea to equip a room inside the cave arose a long time ago. According to some sources, the date of its creation is attributed to 1.700. Previously, lavish balls and large-scale feasts were held there. At that time, Duke Leto ruled, who was the owner of this city, approved the construction of a room in the cave. Soon the place became popular among the upper strata of society.\n",

    "🏞️Russia 🇷🇺, Sulak Canyon\n\n🔶Sulak Canyon is one of the most popular natural attractions of Dagestan. It is attractive both for Dagestanis themselves, who have recently become addicted to active recreation, and for guests of the republic. Tourists are increasingly coming to Dagestan, already knowing exactly where they want to go and what to see. Sulak Canyon is almost always on the wish list.\n \n🔶The canyon stretches across the territory of Dagestan for 53 kilometers. In places it narrows, and in some places the gorge, on the contrary, is so wide that its opposite side is hardly visible. The river looks like a thin and helpless stream from above, but in fact the Sulak is one of the most full—flowing rivers of Dagestan.\n \n🔶The canyon is beautiful from any point, but most often people come to the village of Dubki to admire it. There are several places at once, from where the canyon will appear before you in all its glory. \n",

    "🏡The village of Houtouwan 🇨🇳\n\n🔶About 50 years ago, life in the Chinese village of Hutuvan, located in the east of the country on one of the islands of the Shengshi archipelago, was in full swing: about 2,000 fishermen lived here with their families and there was a large port from where the caught fish were sent to the mainland. However, in the 1990s, the port fell into disrepair, and soon the island was deserted. There were only a few dozen residents who had nowhere to go.\n\n🔶Almost 20 years have passed since the moment, and the village of Hutuvan was completely at the mercy of nature. Ivy and other plants tightly clung to all the buildings, which now look at the world with black gaps of window frames.

    "🏟️Switzerland 🇨🇭, Italy 🇮🇹, Lake Lugano\n\n🔶One of the most beautiful and beloved by tourists lakes in Switzerland is Lake Lugano. Named after the city near which it is located, the lake is a popular place for summer holidays and for the construction of luxury villas. The lake is located on the territory of two countries — the southern part of it is located in the province of Como, Italy. On the shores there is an Italian exclave on Swiss territory — the commune of Campione d'Italia. \n \n🔶With picturesque villages located along the shores and surrounded by green mountains, Lake Lugano is an ideal place for recreation and active tourism. Rather elongated, 36 km long and no more than 2 km wide, Lake Lugano is the only one in Switzerland that has a bridge over it.\n\n🔶Thanks to the clean air, practically free of dust and fog, Lake Lugano is considered the best place for rest and treatment after respiratory tract lesions and for rheumatics. \n",

     "text": "🏟️Switzerland 🇨🇭, Italy 🇮🇹, Lake Lugano\n\n🔶One of the most beautiful and beloved by tourists lakes in Switzerland is Lake Lugano. Named after the city near which it is located, the lake is a popular place for summer holidays and for the construction of luxury villas. The lake is located on the territory of two countries — the southern part of it is located in the province of Como, Italy. On the shores there is an Italian exclave on Swiss territory — the commune of Campione d'Italia. \n \n🔶With picturesque villages located along the shores and surrounded by green mountains, Lake Lugano is an ideal place for recreation and active tourism. Rather elongated, 36 km long and no more than 2 km wide, Lake Lugano is the only one in Switzerland that has a bridge over it.\n\n🔶Thanks to the clean air, practically free of dust and fog, Lake Lugano is considered the best place for rest and treatment after respiratory tract lesions and for rheumatics. \n"

There are a lot of endemics preserved here: the bell–like evergreen shrub – azorina, the clover-like marsilia azorina, the day butterfly Hipparchia azorina, the Azorean evening bat and the Azorean bullfinch. Locals strive to preserve the pristine natural landscape, and therefore eco-tourism is very popular here.\n\n🔶Many travelers come to the Azores to admire the picturesque nature and see the local natural monuments.

    "🏛️Greece 🇬🇷, Acropolis of Athens\n\n🔶The Athenian Acropolis is a 156–meter-high hill with a temple complex erected on it, protecting the townspeople from enemy raids. The upper city, which occupies an area measuring 300 by 130 m, was built over many centuries, starting with the ancient Greek archaic and ending with the era of Roman Greece. \n\n🔶According to legend, the founder of Athens and the Upper City was a half-man, half-snake Cecrope. It was he who preferred the goddess of wisdom as a patroness and erected the first temples in her honor. In the following centuries, more magnificent structures appeared on their ruins, until all the buildings of the Acropolis, with the exception of the fragmentary surviving temple of Hecatompedon, were destroyed by the Persians in the fifth century.

    "Croatia 🇭🇷, Zlatni Rat Beach\n\n🔶Zlatni Rat is the Golden Horn beach on the island of Brac, located opposite the Makarska Riviera. This beach is the most attractive among Croatian beaches, it can be seen on all tourist avenues. It is a huge spit, having almost 580 meters in length, crashed into the sea in the town of Bole.

    "⛪Georgia🇬🇪, Mount Kazbek and Trinity Church\n\n🔶Trinity Church in Gergeti (Gergetis Tsminda Sameba) is located on a hill at the foot of Mount Kazbek. It stands literally above the clouds – the height above sea level is 2170 meters. From below it seems that the monastery is floating in the air, high-high in the mountains – an amazing view!\n\n🔶Why was the church built so high? There is a belief in Georgia that in order to get to God, a person must make an effort for this. Therefore, the temple was built so high that only true believers could overcome the difficult path up the mountain.\n\n🔶The distance from the temple to the Russian border is only 11 km – this is the first attraction that tourists see when entering Georgia through Upper Lars.

    "Spain🇪🇸, Barcelona, Casa Batlló (House of Bones)\n\n🔶The Casa Batlló is an unusual architectural monument located in the center of Barcelona, in the Eixample district, on Paseo de Gracia Avenue. This building is a residential building built in 1877 and reconstructed in 1904-1906 by the brilliant Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi.

    "🏛️Greece 🇬🇷, Melissani Cave\n\n🔶There are places in Greece that have amazing beauty and attractiveness. Many of them are shrouded in secrets, myths and legends. One of these places is the Melissani Cave. It is located on the island of Kefalonia, about two kilometers from the city of Sami. The origin of the cave is associated with a complex geological karst process, thanks to which rocks are dissolved by water. For many millennia, underground and surface waters have made their own passages, destroyed the calcareous rock and formed a cave underground. Part of the cave space is occupied by the underground lake Melissani, whose age exceeds 20 thousand years.\n\n🔶Today, everyone can explore the cave. In 1963, in order to provide easy access to the lake, a tunnel was laid in the rock. It leads underground to a pier with rowboats, on which tourists are taken to the far part of the cave.\n\n",

    "🏰Spain 🇪🇸, Bellver Castle\n\n🔶Bellver Castle (Castel de Bellver), majestically towering on a 140-meter hill, is one of the most famous tourist attractions of Palma de Mallorca. In Spain, this is the only Gothic structure built in 1311, in an unusual round shape for this style. It is located 3 km from the city, which offers magnificent views from it. The panorama of the Bay of Palma is especially fascinating. And in clear weather, even the outlines of Cabrera Island can be seen from here.\n\n🔶The largest tower is considered the main one. Its height is 25 m, and its diameter reaches 12 m. The main tower is oriented exactly to the north, while the other three smaller towers face east, south and west.\n\n🔶Curiosity is aroused by the inner courtyard of the citadel, consisting of a two-story arched gallery. Here you can visit the historical museum and look at ancient sculptures. The citadel itself has a radius of 50 m.\n",

The green island, with densely growing palm trees, outlandish flowers and rare birds, is surrounded by a scattering of small islets.\n"

    "🏰France 🇫🇷, Amboise, Amboise Castle\n\n🔶Amboise Castle is a majestic example of Renaissance architecture.

No seat belts are provided.\n\n🔶The attraction is located on a mountain with a height of 1200 meters. At the moment of a symbolic kiss of two fairy-tale characters, the booths approach each other.

    "Madagascar 🇲🇬, Alley of Baobabs\n\n🔶Baobab is a sacred tree for the inhabitants of Madagascar. He is considered the progenitor of the forest and is revered along with the gods. Baobabs are found not only on this island, but also in Africa, and even in Australia. With the development of agriculture, forests began to be cut down in Madagascar, but baobabs are not touched because of respect for majestic trees. As a result, powerful trunks of sacred trees now rise along the edges of one of the dirt roads.

The entrance to the sea is flat, but not in all places flat.\n\n🔶The village of Novy Svet and its central beach in the Green Bay are located in the southeastern part of Crimea, but despite this, the local climate differs from the rest of the peninsula and is close to subtropical. On both sides, the bay is surrounded by the Falcon and Eagle mountains, so the coast is reliably protected from the winds. Another feature of the resort village is the warm current, thanks to which the water in the sea warms up faster. \n",

    "Kyrgyzstan 🇰🇬, Lake Sary-Chelek\n\n🔶The alpine lake Sary-Chelek with dignity bears the title of one of the most beautiful places on the planet. It is located at an altitude of almost 2 km above sea level in the foothill zone of the Chatkal ridge, five hundred kilometers from the capital of Kyrgyzstan and three hundred from the city of Osh. \n\n🔶Sary-Chelek Lake is not only the main decoration of the reserve of the same name, but also the second deepest lake in Kyrgyzstan, its average depth is 98 meters, and the maximum depth is 234 meters. Dozens of streams flow down from the gorges surrounding the lake.\nThe northern coast of Sary-Chelek is decorated with coniferous forests, so dense that it creates the feeling of real Siberian massifs. And the unique smell of pine needles only aggravates the impression. The power of the forests is reflected in the turquoise surface of the lake.\n",

    "Italy🇮🇹, Capri, Blue Grotto\n\n🔶The Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra) is the main natural attraction of the popular Italian island of Capri, known since the Roman Empire.

    "Italy🇮🇹, Florence, Ponte Vecchio Bridge\n\n🔶The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is among the top most famous sights of Florence. Ponte Vecchio was built in the XIV century, it connects the two banks of the Arno River at the narrowest point. The ferry has been here for centuries. The ancient Romans were the first to build a wooden bridge on stone piles at this place. The structure was destroyed by a flood in 1117. The bridge was built anew, using only stone during its construction. A new flood in 1333 destroyed it as well. The familiar view of the Ponte Vecchio was received in 1345. Architect Neri di Fioravanti designed a reliable but elegant three-arch structure.\n\n🔶The Ponte Vecchio is the only bridge in Florence that has preserved its medieval appearance. Today there are jewelry shops open here. By the way, the prices here are very high. The Ponte Vecchio Bridge must be admired from the shore. The best view is from the embankment or from Michelangelo Square.\n",

It was first discovered in the middle of spring 1941.\n\n🔶Along the Geyser River there is a canyon, the total area of which is up to 6 km2. Within these limits, arranged by nature, there is a valley of geysers, containing many geyser outlets, mud pits, waterfalls, thermal pads, natural reservoirs, hot springs.\n\n🔶According to the results of the voting held in 2008, the Valley of Geysers was included in the Seven Wonders of Russia.\n\n🔶You can get to the valley only by buying a helicopter tour from a travel agency, as it is protected by a protected regime.\n"

Nevertheless, the best time to visit this attraction is the rainy season, which lasts from November to April. At this time, the cascades are the most full-flowing and picturesque.

A strong right stream falling from the maximum height for this waterfall is distinguished by crystal clear water.\n\n🔶There are usually few tourists on the observation deck and at the foot of Sekumpul: the waterfall is considered difficult to access, and there are no mass bus excursions to it.\n"

    "China 🇨🇳, Chinese Venice\n\n🔶Not far from Shanghai there is a very ancient small town of Zhouzhuang. In 1086, the local rich man Zhou Digong donated 13 hectares of land to the Taoist monastery, which still exists today, has been repeatedly rebuilt and expanded.\n\n🔶The town began to grow rapidly. Intellectuals, artists, various dignitaries settled here, who spared no money for the construction of their houses and bridges. Zhouzhuang is surrounded on all sides by rivers and lakes connected by canals, which are the streets of the town. Almost every house has its own pier. There are also paved sidewalks on which you can walk.\n\n🔶Most of the houses are architectural monuments. A two-storey mansion built in 1742 is very interesting. It occupies 2000 square meters, has 100 rooms, 7 courtyards, 5 arches. The luxurious residence, built in 1436-1449, during the Ming Dynasty, belonged to the Zhang family. It occupies 1800 square meters, has 70 rooms and 6 courtyards.\n",

    "Northern Ireland 🇬🇧, Giant's Causeway\n\n🔶This road or path of giants was formed many millions of years ago during a volcanic eruption.

The highest of them is 12 m high and forms a kind of springboard. Gradually, this road becomes lower and goes under water.

The main thing in this reservoir is not its size, but the picturesque landscapes and clean air of the surroundings, which tirelessly attract travelers.\n\n🔶The surface of the lake freezes every year, the ice usually lasts from December to May. However, even in winter, Eshinen does not cease to be a tourist destination. Almost all year round you can order fishing on the lake.\n"

    "🌉USA 🇺🇸, Royal Gorge Bridge\n\n🔶The Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado is the tallest suspension bridge in the United States. Its length is 384 meters and its width is 5 meters. Impressive in its appearance is not only the bridge itself, but also its towers located on the edges of the cliff. Their height is 46 meters. \n\n🔶The two main support cables weigh 20 tons each and are a plexus of 2,100 individual cables. It took 1,292 wooden beams to build the spans. At the bottom, at a distance of 300 meters, there is an intermountain river. When walking, the bridge sways noticeably, because it does not have any supports in its middle.\n\n🔶Until 2011, Royal Gorge was considered the highest bridge in the world. It was built in 1929 for only $350,000. The bridge stretches for as much as 384 meters across the majestic Royal Gorge Canyon of Colorado. At the bottom, 291 meters under the bridge, the Arkansas River flows, periodically carrying away brave rafting lovers downstream.\n",

    "Bulgaria 🇧🇬, Seven Rila Lakes\n\n🔶The natural pearl of Bulgaria, the high-altitude Rila lakes are located at an altitude of 2100-2500 meters above sea level. The landscape around is unearthly: there is not too much greenery, mostly mountains — and, of course, the purest water, in which the sky is reflected. The lakes are glacial, so the water is very cold: you won't be able to hold your hand for a minute. In general, there is no question of bathing.\n\n🔶The main system of the Rila lakes includes seven — Fish, Long, Shamrock, Gemini, Kidney, Eye and Tear. The tear is the highest and cleanest, the water is so transparent that it allows you to see far into the depths. The Lake of Eyes is perfectly oval in shape. The Kidney lake resembles this organ in shape. Gemini is the largest lake in the park. The shamrock also bears this name because of its shape. The shallowest lake is the Fish Lake, and the Bottom One is located below all of them.\n",

    "Great Britain 🇬🇧, Beachy Head Cape\n\n🔶Beachy Head Cape is the highest seaside chalk cliff in the UK (162 meters), a famous natural landmark in the vicinity of Eastbourne\n\n🔶For a long time, the high cape was a landmark for English sailors, even mentioned in British folklore — the folk song Spanish Ladies.\n\n🔶The Belle Tout lighthouse on the sea at the cape was built in 1831.

    "Irish🇮🇪, Dingle Peninsula\n\n🔶The Dingle Peninsula in the southwestern part of Ireland is the northernmost of the five peninsulas that jut into the waters of the Atlantic like the fingers of a hand, and Cape Dunmore Head is known as the westernmost point of the mainland of Ireland. On each of the peninsulas there are mountain ranges, and on the Dingle Peninsula there are Sliv Mish Mountains. The highest peak is Brandon with a height of 953m, the second highest peak in Ireland.\n\n🔶The peninsula is known for its magnificent landscapes and stunning monuments of the early Christian era, Iron Age fortifications and picturesque gorges. Dingle is a wonderfully located village at the foot of Ballysitterach Mountain. Fishing boats are still going to the harbor, which is almost closed by us, so we can consider the village an ideal base for exploring the antiquities on the peninsula. The main attraction is the dolphin Fangi, who has been living in the bay since 1984.\n",

    "USA 🇺🇸, Lake Powell\n\n🔶Lake Powell is not a natural lake. It was formed above a dam with a power plant blocking the Colorado River. The Colorado flows through soft limestone rocks, forming canyons in many places. The largest and most famous of them is the Grand Canyon. But there are others, for example, located next to Page Glen Canyon. It follows the Colorado riverbed, and numerous tributary canyons flow into it. The water in Lake Powell is bright blue, the sky above the lake is bright blue. Incredible landscapes, numerous fjords flowing into the main canyon, small sandy beaches hidden behind rocks, caves, arches, silence and tranquility make this place ideal for relaxing on a boat or yacht. The relative remoteness from densely populated areas does not contribute to a too rapid influx of tourists, which also adds charm to this place. \n \n🔶Here you can rent a motor boat, yacht or scooter and spend the day on the water.\n",

But there are others, for example, located next to Page Glen Canyon. It follows the Colorado riverbed, and numerous tributary canyons flow into it. The water in Lake Powell is bright blue, the sky above the lake is bright blue. Incredible landscapes, numerous fjords flowing into the main canyon, small sandy beaches hidden behind rocks, caves, arches, silence and tranquility make this place ideal for relaxing on a boat or yacht. The relative remoteness from densely populated areas does not contribute to a too rapid influx of tourists, which also adds charm to this place. \n \n🔶Here you can rent a motor boat, yacht or scooter and spend the day on the water.\n"

First of all, it concerned his forms. Gaudi remained true to his unique style. The facade of the Casa Mila is devoid of straight lines, corners - it seems to flow and shimmer. This effect was achieved thanks to the smooth bending, turning into one another, round and elliptical shapes, as well as decorative grids in the form of seaweed.\n\nThe roof is supported by arched arches made of brick – there are 270 of them in total.",

If you look from a bird's-eye view, the shape of the Moorea resembles a triangle, but for people with even more imagination, it seems that it looks like a heart. Therefore, it has become a popular venue for weddings and honeymoons. This is really a paradise for lovers.\n\nThere are cozy and quiet coves, gentle lagoons, soft beaches and turquoise waters of the Pacific Ocean. You can go scuba diving near the coast, explore the coral reefs that nature has decorated the coastal waters of Moorea or feed the sharks.\n\nThe highest point of the Moray Eel is the peak of the Town Hall Mountain, which rises 900 meters above sea level. The island occupies 133.50 km2 and is home to about 14 thousand people.",

     "text": "French Polynesia 🇵🇫, Moorea Island\n\nMoorea Island is one of the windward islands of the \"Society Islands\" archipelago in French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean, located 17 km northwest of Tahiti.\n\n Translated from Polynesian, its name means \"yellow lizard\". If you look from a bird's-eye view, the shape of the Moorea resembles a triangle, but for people with even more imagination, it seems that it looks like a heart. Therefore, it has become a popular venue for weddings and honeymoons. This is really a paradise for lovers.\n\nThere are cozy and quiet coves, gentle lagoons, soft beaches and turquoise waters of the Pacific Ocean. You can go scuba diving near the coast, explore the coral reefs that nature has decorated the coastal waters of Moorea or feed the sharks.\n\nThe highest point of the Moray Eel is the peak of the Town Hall Mountain, which rises 900 meters above sea level. The island occupies 133.50 km2 and is home to about 14 thousand people."

This can be done only in favorable weather.  The road is quite heavy.

Parku Kombëtar i Thethit) is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful natural attractions in Albania. \n\nThe territory of the park is located in the North Albanian Alps at an altitude of 1200 - 2567 m above sea level.\n\nTet Park is a quiet and secluded place high in the mountains among the incredible natural silence because it is not easy to get to these beautiful places. This can be done only in favorable weather.  The road is quite heavy. Despite the fact that the distance from the city of Shkoder to the village of Tet is about 75 km, you will have to drive at least 4 hours.

Vipiteno is considered one of the most beautiful cities in Italy, its name constantly flashes in the constantly compiled various ratings.\n\nThe city has its roots in 14 BC, when Nero Claudius Drusus founded a military camp called \"Vipitenum\" along the road between Italy and Germany.\n\n75% of the city's residents speak their native German. All the signs in Vipiteno are presented in German and Italian.\n\nMulti-colored painted houses with bay windows and stepped gables are the main feature of Vipiteno. The houses look completely toy-like.\n\nThere is only one Vipiteno in the old town (but what!) central pedestrian street via citta nuova (via città nuova). Walking through it is like getting into an old fairy tale from childhood. You're just waiting for a gnome to look out of the doorway of a toy house."

Today it is a very beautiful city, which is visited by thousands of tourists who want to visit the Trakai National Park, and, of course, to see the Trakai Castle.\n\nSince the attraction is located on the island, you can only get to it by the bridge connecting the fortress with the city. In 1962, a museum dedicated to the history of Trakai was founded on the territory of the castle, and souvenir shops were opened. The best time to visit it is in the morning on weekdays.

The pool covers a total of 11,200 kilometers, and the length is 320 kilometers.\n\nNot only the steppe is named after the river, but also the largest road in the Altai Mountains — the Chuisky Tract. In the area of 713 km of the highway, you can visit the confluence of the two main rivers of Altai, Chui and Katuni.\n\nHere, a fascinating sight appears before the eyes of a tourist, as the waters of the turquoise Katun connect with the turbid milky waters of Chuya.

The pool covers a total of 11,200 kilometers, and the length is 320 kilometers.\n\nNot only the steppe is named after the river, but also the largest road in the Altai Mountains — the Chuisky Tract. In the area of 713 km of the highway, you can visit the confluence of the two main rivers of Altai, Chui and Katuni.\n\nHere, a fascinating sight appears before the eyes of a tourist, as the waters of the turquoise Katun connect with the turbid milky waters of Chuya. In order to see this, a special observation deck is organized 500 m from the highway on a hill, to which a road is laid directly from the highway.\n\nAlso, the Chuya River is notable for meanders.

They are also called pale mountains because of the amazing reflection of the bright light of the moon.\n\nThe Dolomites are inhabited by a people who call themselves Ladins. They do not consider themselves Italians, even though they live in this state. The people speak Ladin, an interesting combination of adverbs, Italian and German words.

Translated means \"needles\".\n\nOne of the features of these mountains is their ability to change color under the influence of sunlight, during sunrise or sunset. They can be pale orange or pink in hue. They are also called pale mountains because of the amazing reflection of the bright light of the moon.\n\nThe Dolomites are inhabited by a people who call themselves Ladins. They do not consider themselves Italians, even though they live in this state. The people speak Ladin, an interesting combination of adverbs, Italian and German words. Ladin people have their own national cuisine, traditions and customs. The people belong to the Romanesque type, there are about 35,000 Ladins in total, they also live in Switzerland."

   "text": "Saint Martin 🇧🇶 🇫🇷, Maho Beach\n\nMaho Beach is notable for the fact that a giant passenger liner such as a Boeing 767 or Airbus A320 can fly over your head at a height of only a couple of tens of meters. And the plane can fly over the beach at any time of the day or night. As you know, planes flying over the beach are not an attraction for tourists at all. Flying over a small beach, the plane lands literally behind its fence.\n\nThe beach and the beginning of the landing strip are separated by a highway and a fence made of mesh. The airport, located just behind the beach, has a fairly limited strip with a length of only 2,300 meters and ends with Simpson Lagoon. This is a fairly short stretch for large aircraft.\n\nIt turns out such a narrow tie, surrounded by water, on which the plane should get. He has to descend as much as possible to land at the very beginning of the lane. Therefore, planes fly over the beach, almost clinging to the heads of tourists with their landing gear.",
